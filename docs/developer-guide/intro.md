# Developer Guide Introduction

Welcome to the plugNmeet Developer Guide. This section is designed for developers and system integrators who want to move beyond the standard plugins and deeply integrate plugNmeet into their own applications.

Whether you want to build a fully white-labeled video conferencing solution, create complex business logic, or contribute to the open-source project, this guide is your starting point.

## What You Can Achieve

plugNmeet is more than just a video conferencing tool; it's a flexible WebRTC platform built on a modern, API-driven architecture. With it, you can:

*   **Build a Custom, White-Label Experience:** Use our `getClientFiles` API to embed and completely re-brand the plugNmeet front-end client directly within your own application, without being trapped in an `iframe`.
*   **Automate and Manage Rooms:** Programmatically create, manage, and authenticate users for meetings using our comprehensive server-side APIs.
*   **Extend Functionality with Webhooks:** Listen for real-time events within a meeting (such as user join/leave, recording start/stop, etc.) to trigger custom workflows in your application.
*   **Scale for Massive Audiences:** Learn the architectural concepts required to build a distributed, high-availability deployment capable of supporting a massive user base.

## How to Get Started

1.  **Explore the API Introduction:** This is the best place to start. It provides a complete reference for all available server endpoints and their parameters.
2.  **Review the Design Customization Guide:** Learn how to use a simple JavaScript object to completely change the look and feel of the front-end client.
3.  **Check out our SDKs:** For faster integration, we provide official SDKs for popular languages like PHP and JavaScript.

We're excited to see what you build with plugNmeet!
