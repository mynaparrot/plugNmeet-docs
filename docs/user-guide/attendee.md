# Attendee Guide: How to Join and Participate in a Meeting

Welcome to the Attendee Guide! This document will walk you through everything you need to know to successfully join and participate in a Plug-N-Meet video conference.

---

## First Steps: Joining a Meeting

When you first enter a PlugNmeet room, you will be prompted to choose how you want to join the audio session. This is your most important first step.

-   **Microphone:** Choose this option to speak and participate in the meeting. Your browser will ask for permission to access your microphone.
-   **Listen only:** Choose this option to join without a microphone. You will be able to hear everything but will not be able to speak.

**Important:** This choice is not permanent. If you join in "Listen only" mode, you can easily activate your microphone later from the main control bar (if the moderator allows it).

## Section 1: The Attendee Control Bar

These are the basic controls you will use during the meeting, located at the bottom of the screen.

-   **Microphone:** Click this icon to mute or unmute yourself.
-   **Webcam:** Click this icon to start or stop sharing your webcam. You can choose a virtual background before you share.
-   **Raise Hand:** Click this icon to signal to the moderator that you have a question or wish to speak.

## Section 3: Viewing Content

The moderator can share various types of content during the meeting.

-   **Viewing a Shared Screen:** If the moderator shares their screen, it will automatically appear in the main area of the interface.
-   **Interacting with the Whiteboard:** If the moderator activates the whiteboard, you will be able to see what they are drawing. They may also give you permission to draw on the whiteboard yourself.
-   **Viewing a Shared Video:** If the moderator shares a video, it will appear on your screen with playback controls.

## Section 4: Breakout Rooms

The moderator can split the main session into smaller Breakout Rooms for group activities.

-   If you are assigned to a room, you will see a notification inviting you to **Join**.
-   You will be taken to a new, smaller meeting room. When the breakout session is over, you will be returned to the main room automatically.
