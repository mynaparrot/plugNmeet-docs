# Attendee Guide: How to Join and Participate in a Meeting

Welcome to the Attendee Guide! This document will walk you through everything you need to know to successfully join and participate in a Plug-N-Meet video conference.

## First Steps: Joining a Meeting

When you first enter a PlugNmeet room, you will be prompted to choose how you want to join the audio session. This is your most important first step.

-   **Enable Microphone and Camera:** Choose this option to speak and share your video in the meeting. Your browser will ask for permission to access your microphone and camera.
-   **Continue as a listener:** Choose this option to join without a microphone or camera. You will be able to hear everything but will not be able to speak or share video.

**Important:** This choice is not permanent. If you decide to **Continue as a listener**, you can easily activate your microphone and camera later from the main control bar (if the moderator allows it).

## Section 1: The Attendee Control Bar

These are the basic controls you will use during the meeting, located at the bottom of the screen.

-   **Microphone:** Click this icon to mute or unmute yourself.
-   **Webcam:** Click this icon to start or stop sharing your webcam. You can choose a virtual background before you share.
