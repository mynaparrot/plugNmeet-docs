# Moderator Guide: How to Host and Manage a Meeting

Welcome to the Moderator Guide. This document provides a complete overview of all the features and controls available to you as a meeting host or moderator.

The moderator has full control over the meeting, including managing participants, using presentation tools, and configuring room settings. This guide is structured to help you quickly find the feature you need.

## First Steps: Entering the Room & Choosing Your Audio

When you first enter a PlugNmeet room, you will be prompted to choose how you want to join the audio session. This is your most important first step.

![Onboarding-Desktop.jpg](/img/moderator/Onboarding-Desktop.jpg)

-   **Enable Microphone and Camera:** Choose this option to speak and share your video in the meeting. Your browser will ask for permission to access your microphone and camera.
-   **Continue as a listener:** Choose this option to join without a microphone or camera. You will be able to hear everything but will not be able to speak or share video.

**Important:** This choice is not permanent. If you decide to **Continue as a listener**, you can easily activate your microphone and camera later from the main control bar.

## Section 5: Session Management

These actions control the overall meeting session.

### Recording the Meeting

Plug-N-Meet offers two distinct methods for recording your session: **Cloud Recording** (server-side) and **Local Recording** (browser-based). To start either, click the **REC** icon in the main control bar and choose your preferred option.

![recording.png](/img/moderator/recording.png)

#### Cloud Recording (Recommended)

This is the most reliable method. The recording is processed on your server, capturing the entire session without depending on your local computer's performance.

-   **Requirement:** To use Cloud Recording, the free and open-source `plugNmeet-recorder` component must have been installed on your server. This is an option during the main installation process.
-   **Troubleshooting:** If you see a "No recorder available" message, it means this component is not running on your server.
-   **How it works:** Simply select "Cloud Recording" to start. The REC icon will pulse to indicate that the server is recording. Click it again to stop.

#### Local Recording (Browser-Based)

This method uses your web browser's capabilities to capture and save the meeting directly to your computer. It has very specific requirements and is **only supported in Google Chrome**.

> **Important:** Local Recording is an advanced feature. For the best results, please read the following instructions carefully.

To capture all audio within the session (not just your own microphone), the recording must be performed by a "virtual" second user.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Open a new Chrome window** (not just a new tab).
2.  Using the new window, **log in to the same meeting with a different user account** that has moderator privileges. You will now have two instances of yourself in the meeting.
3.  In this second window, click the **REC** icon and choose **Local Recording**.
4.  A Chrome prompt will appear asking you to share a tab. Select the tab of your *original* meeting session.
5.  **Crucial Step:** At the bottom of the Chrome prompt, you **must** check the box that says **"Share tab audio"**. If you do not enable this, only the video will be recorded, with no sound.

**Alternative Method (for capturing your microphone only):**

If you only need to record what your microphone picks up along with the main video, you can start local recording without a second user. However, you must **share your microphone first**, and *then* start the local recording. If you start recording before sharing your mic, your own audio will be excluded.

### Application Settings

- Click the three-dot menu in the **top-right** corner and select **Settings**.
- Here you can change the application language, manage data-saving preferences, toggle notification sounds, and manage Live Stream settings.

![app-settings.webp](/img/moderator/app-settings.webp)

### Ending vs. Logging Out of a Meeting

- **Leave Meeting:** If you select **Leave Meeting** from the top-right menu, you will leave the meeting, but the session will remain active for other participants.
- **End Meeting:** If you select **End meeting**, the session will be terminated for **everyone**.
