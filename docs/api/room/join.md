# Join Room

Endpoint: `/room/getJoinToken`

This endpoint generates a temporary token that grants a user access to a specific room. Before diving into the parameters, here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

*   **Token Lifecycle**: The generated token is short-lived (its validity period is set in your server configuration) and designed for **one-time use**. You should consume it immediately by redirecting the user to the meeting URL. **Do not store this token for future use.**

*   **User ID Uniqueness**:
    *   Plug-N-Meet requires every participant in a session to have a unique `user_id`.
    *   If you created the room with `auto_gen_user_id: false` (the default), you are responsible for providing a unique `user_id` for each user.
    *   If a new user joins with a `user_id` that is already active in the room, the existing participant with that ID will be automatically disconnected. This is useful for allowing users to switch devices seamlessly.

*   **Room Existence**: You can only generate a join token for a room that has already been created and is currently active.

## Response

| Field  | Type    | Position | Description               |
| ------ | ------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| status | boolean | root     | Indicates if the request was successful. |
| msg    | string  | root     | Response message.         |
| token  | string  | root     | The join token.           |

### Using the Join Token

Once you receive the `token`, you can grant the user access to the meeting room. There are two ways to pass the token to the Plug-N-Meet client:

1.  **As a URL parameter (recommended)**: Pass the token in the query string as `access_token`.
2.  **As a cookie**: Set a cookie named `pnm_access_token` with the token as its value.

The URL parameter is the most straightforward method. Here's an example:

```
https://Your-Plug-N-Meet-Server.com/?access_token=<TOKEN HERE>
```

If you are hosting the [plugNmeet-client](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-client) static files elsewhere, you should also pass the token in the same way. For example, if your static files are in a `conference` directory:

```
https://Your-Domain.com/conference/?access_token=<TOKEN HERE>
```

**Note:** You can also use the [getClientFiles](/docs/api/get-client-files) API to retrieve all the CSS and JS files required to display the interface manually. This allows you to embed the Plug-N-Meet client anywhere without worrying about static build files.

## Custom Design

You can add an extra query parameter called `custom_design` to the join link to apply a unique design for each user. The value of `custom_design` should be a URL-encoded JSON object. Supported parameters can be found in the [design-parameters](/docs/developer-guide/design-customisation#design-parameters) documentation. Example:

```
https://Your-Domain.com/conference/?access_token=<TOKEN HERE>&custom_design=%7B%22primary_color%22%3A%22%23004D90%22%2C%22secondary_color%22%3A%22%2324AEF7%22%7D
```
