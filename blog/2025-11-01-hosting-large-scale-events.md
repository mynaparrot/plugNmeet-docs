We get the question all the time: "Can Plug-N-Meet support 3,000 attendees in a single meeting?"

The dream is huge: a massive online conference, a global product launch, or an all-hands meeting for a thousand-person company. The first instinct is to find a tool that can cram everyone into one giant virtual room.

But let me be honest: from years of experience in this industry, that approach is a technical and financial nightmare. It's a recipe for chaos, spiraling infrastructure costs, and a poor user experience.

The good news? There's a much smarter, more professional, and incredibly cost-effective way to do it. And you can do it with Plug-N-Meet.

### The Problem with the "One Giant Room" Model

Imagine trying to manage a live stage with 1,000 audience members all having a hot mic. That's what a 1000-person interactive video call is.

*   **Spiraling Costs:** The server infrastructure required to handle thousands of individual, real-time video and audio streams is astronomically expensive.
*   **A Recipe for Chaos:** Moderating a room of that size is impossible. Accidental un-mutes, background noise, and chat overload make for a terrible audience experience.
*   **The Performance Bottleneck:** Even with a powerful server, the sheer number of connections creates a massive performance bottleneck, leading to lag, freezes, and a degraded experience for everyone.

The giants of the industry don't do it this way. They use a hybrid model. And now, so can you.

### The Technical Challenge of a Single Massive Room

Now, some organizations have a specific requirement to keep all participants in a single, fully interactive room. It's important to understand the technical barrier here. Standard open-source media servers, including the open-source version of LiveKit, are designed to run a single room's session on a single server. This means that even a very powerful machine will eventually hit a ceiling on the number of interactive participants it can handle.

Overcoming this requires a more complex, commercial-grade infrastructure capable of clustering a single session across multiple servers. For those looking to scale their own self-hosted deployment, we provide a detailed **[Scalable Deployment Guide](/docs/developer-guide/scalable-setup)**. However, for the vast majority of large-scale events, the Broadcast Studio Model remains the most cost-effective, stable, and professional approach. Let's explore how to set that up.

### The Solution: The Broadcast Studio Model

Instead of one giant, chaotic room, think like a television producer. You need two things: a private, controlled **Studio** for your speakers, and a massive, scalable **Audience Venue** for your viewers.

1.  **Your Studio:** A private, high-quality Plug-N-Meet session with just your key speakers, panelists, and a moderator. This is your control room.
2.  **Your Venue:** A public live stream on a platform built for massive one-to-many distribution, like **YouTube**, **Facebook**, **LinkedIn**, or **Twitch**.

With Plug-N-Meet, you can seamlessly connect your private studio to your public venue.

### How It Works: The Simple Steps to a Professional Event

This isn't a complex technical challenge; it's a simple workflow that Plug-N-Meet is perfectly designed for.

1.  **Start Your Private Studio:** Create a standard Plug-N-Meet session. Invite your 5-10 speakers, panelists, and producers. Inside this room, you have full, high-quality, interactive collaboration.
2.  **Go Live to the World:** From the main menu, the moderator selects **Live Broadcasting** and pastes the stream key from their chosen platform (e.g., YouTube). With one click, your private session is now being broadcast live to the world.
3.  **Engage Your Audience:** Share the public YouTube or Facebook link with your 1,000 attendees. They get a rock-solid, high-definition viewing experience powered by the world's best streaming infrastructureâ€”for free.
4.  **Bring the Audience "On Stage":** This is the magic. Want to take a question from the audience?
    *   Share a separate, private Plug-N-Meet join link with your attendees.
    *   When a user clicks it, they land in your **Waiting Room**.
    *   As the moderator, you can see a list of people waiting. When you're ready, you simply click **"Accept"** to bring a specific audience member directly into your live studio.
    *   They can ask their question on camera, interact with the panelists, and then, when they're done, you can dismiss them from the studio, and they seamlessly return to watching the public stream.

You have just created a professional, interactive broadcast, bringing guests "on stage" just like a real television show.

### The Benefits Are Huge

*   **Massive Scalability, Minimal Cost:** You only need a server powerful enough for your ~10 speakers, not 1,000 attendees. You let YouTube and Facebook handle the massive cost and complexity of global distribution for you.
*   **High-Quality, Controlled Production:** Your core session is clean, private, and easy to moderate. No more chaos.
*   **True Audience Interaction:** You still get the engagement of a live Q&A, but in a structured, professional, and manageable way.
