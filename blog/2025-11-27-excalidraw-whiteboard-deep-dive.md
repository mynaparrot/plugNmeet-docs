If you've ever taught a class online, you've likely experienced this frustrating moment. You're in the middle of a great discussion, and you want to illustrate a point on a whiteboard. You click the "whiteboard" button, and suddenly, a completely new application opens up in another window.

It has a different design, a different set of tools, and it feels... disconnected. Your students are now looking at a separate program, not your classroom. This is the "plugin" approach, and while it works, it's often clunky and unintuitive.

At plugNmeet, we believe your tools should feel like a natural part of your classroom, not a separate gadget you have to bolt on. That's why our whiteboard is **truly built-in**, designed from the ground up to be a seamless and powerful part of your teaching experience.

## The Problem with "Plugin" Whiteboards

Many video platforms integrate a whiteboard by simply linking to an external tool, like Google Jamboard or Miro. This creates several problems for teachers and students:

*   **A Jarring Experience:** Switching to a new window or tab breaks the flow of the lesson and can confuse students.
*   **Limited Features:** Often, these external tools don't work properly in smaller "breakout rooms," limiting your ability to run group activities.
*   **Lag and Delays:** Because the tool is running separately, there can be a noticeable delay between when you draw something and when your students see it.
*   **Lack of Control:** The controls for the whiteboard are separate from your main meeting controls, making it harder to manage your classroom effectively.

## The plugNmeet Difference: A Truly Native Tool

We didn't just add a link to a whiteboard. We built one directly into the heart of plugNmeet. Here’s why that makes all the difference for you as an educator.

### 1. It Feels Instant and Seamless
Because our whiteboard is part of the core application, every line you draw appears on your students' screens instantly. There's no frustrating lag. This is possible because our unique architecture is built for speed, ensuring everyone is always on the same page, literally.

### 2. It’s More Than a Blank Canvas
A classroom whiteboard isn't just for drawing. It's for reviewing work. We built this directly into our tool. You can **upload PDF documents and Office files** right onto the canvas. This allows you to:
*   Display a worksheet and have students circle the answers together.
*   Pull up a presentation slide and highlight key points.
*   Review a student's paper and add notes directly on the document.

### 3. You Have Real Classroom Control
As a teacher, you need control. Our built-in whiteboard gives you simple, powerful moderation tools with a single click:
*   **Lock the board** to make it "view-only" while you are presenting.
*   **Allow any student** to draw and add to the board.
*   **Enable multi-user drawing** so the entire class can brainstorm together.

### 4. It Works Everywhere, Especially in Breakout Rooms
This is one of the biggest differences. Unlike other platforms where advanced tools often disappear in breakout rooms, our whiteboard retains its full power. Students can work together on documents, solve problems, and brainstorm on their own collaborative canvas in each breakout room, just as they would in the main session.

## Conclusion: The Best Tool is the One You Don't Notice

Our philosophy is simple: your teaching tools shouldn't get in your way. They should feel so natural and integrated that you don't even think about them.

By building our whiteboard as a core, native feature, we've created a fast, powerful, and seamless collaborative space that truly belongs in your classroom. It’s not an add-on or a plugin; it's simply part of the room.
