A few scattered &quot;yes&quot; messages in the chat, buried between &quot;hello from Brazil&quot; and a question about something else entirely. You have no real data, no clear consensus, and no way to gauge the true opinion of your audience.</p>
<p>Text chat is great for conversation, but it&#x27;s a terrible tool for structured feedback.</p>
<p>At Plug-N-Meet, we believe that understanding your audience shouldn&#x27;t be a guessing game. That&#x27;s why we built a simple, powerful <strong>Live Polling</strong> feature directly into the core meeting experience.

<p>But what is the true cost of &quot;free&quot;?</p>
<p>Too often, the price isn&#x27;t on the invoice; it&#x27;s hidden in the terms of service. You pay with your data, your brand identity, and your control.

<p>A successful meeting isn&#x27;t just about good content; it&#x27;s about good management. The difference between a chaotic, unprofessional session and a smooth, engaging one often comes down to a single question: <strong>who is in control?</strong></p>

Using off-the-shelf video conferencing tools can create a compliance nightmare. How do you ensure patient data is secure? How do you sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with a public cloud vendor whose data practices are a black box? How do you create a seamless, trusted experience for your patients?</p>
<p>The answer is to <strong>own your stack</strong>.</p>
<p>Building a telehealth platform requires a foundation of absolute control over your data and infrastructure. This is why forward-thinking healthcare companies are turning to self-hosted, open-source platforms like <strong>plugNmeet</strong> to serve as the secure communication core for their applications. This article explains how.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_VAKv padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/telehealth">telehealth</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/hipaa">hipaa</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/security">security</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/privacy">privacy</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/api">api</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/white-label">white-label</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/healthcare">healthcare</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Building a HIPAA-Compliant Telehealth Platform with an Open-Source Core" href="/blog/hipaa-compliant-telehealth-platform"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ndl5"><a href="/blog/true-white-label-video-conferencing">Beyond the Logo: What True White-Label Video Conferencing Looks Like</a></h2><div class="container_iT3w margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-11-02T00:00:00.000Z">November 2, 2025</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Ve2T"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pjAe" src="https://github.com/saimonzone.png" alt="Chaboud Simon"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_YML7"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_mzLN" translate="no">Chaboud Simon</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_SoHM" title="Community &amp; Marketing Lead">Community &amp; Marketing Lead</small><div class="authorSocials_OsyH"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>The term &quot;white-label&quot; is used a lot in the software world. Too often, it simply means you can replace the provider&#x27;s logo with your own. You&#x27;re still stuck with their user interface, their workflow, and their branding on the URL. It’s like putting your own sign on a franchise restaurant—it might have your name on the door, but it&#x27;s still their kitchen and their menu.</p>
<p>At plugNmeet, we believe true white-labeling is not about hiding our brand; it&#x27;s about <strong>empowering you to build your own.</strong></p>
<p>Our platform is designed not as a finished product to be re-skinned, but as a flexible canvas for you to create a deeply integrated, pixel-perfect communication experience that feels like a native part of your application. This article explores the three levels of customization that make this possible.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_VAKv padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/white-label">white-label</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/customization">customization</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/branding">branding</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/developer">developer</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/api">api</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/saas">saas</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Beyond the Logo: What True White-Label Video Conferencing Looks Like" href="/blog/true-white-label-video-conferencing"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ndl5"><a href="/blog/hosting-large-scale-events-the-smart-way">Hosting a 1000-Person Event?

<p>But after years in the trenches, supporting live sessions, online classes, and events at scale, we found ourselves running into the same fundamental walls. We weren&#x27;t just using the software; we were experiencing its architectural limits firsthand. The frustration wasn&#x27;t just about bugs; it was about an architecture that, while powerful for its original purpose, presented challenges for the kind of elastic scalability and developer agility that modern web applications demand.</p>
<p>We realized we had a choice: continue building workarounds, or take everything we had learned and build the solution we knew our users needed.</p>
<p>We chose to build.

<p>An online workshop shouldn&#x27;t be a passive presentation. It should be a dynamic, collaborative experience. But to achieve that, you need more than just a video link; you need an integrated toolkit where every feature works together seamlessly.</p>

You’re in an important online meeting, the chat is full of crucial links, and then you accidentally hit refresh. Everything is gone. To solve this, many applications store your entire session on their backend servers. This allows them to restore your session, but it comes at a huge cost: your sensitive data is now stored permanently on someone else&#x27;s hard drive.</p>
<p>At plugNmeet, we believe this is the wrong trade-off. We&#x27;ve made a deliberate architectural choice to use <strong>your browser&#x27;s own storage</strong> to provide a resilient experience without compromising your privacy.</p>

Is it just a collection of video and audio streams? Or is it a faithful replica of a live, interactive experience?</p>
<p>At Plug-N-Meet, we believe a recording should be a perfect, trustworthy artifact. When you watch it back, the whiteboard annotations should appear at the exact moment the speaker was discussing them. The chat messages should pop up in perfect sync with the conversation. The shared presentation should be exactly as the audience saw it.</p>
<p>To achieve this perfect fidelity, we made a deliberate architectural choice for our recorder: we record the <strong>final, rendered output</strong>, not just the individual parts.

You want to own your brand, manage your audience, and create a unique, professional presentation without being locked into the expensive, rigid ecosystem of proprietary tools like Zoom Webinars or GoToWebinar.</p>
<p>Many open-source projects offer a basic meeting experience. But a webinar is not just a meeting. It has a different structure, different roles, and different goals. You need a platform that understands this distinction.</p>
<p>At plugNmeet, we believe the best webinar experience isn&#x27;t a one-size-fits-all tool. It&#x27;s a flexible, API-first platform that gives you the building blocks to create the <em>exact</em> webinar workflow you need.

<p>You generate a Zoom link, post it on your site, and hope your users can find it, log in correctly, and navigate back when it&#x27;s over. This experience is clunky, disjointed, and it breaks the seamless learning environment you&#x27;ve worked so hard to build.</p>

However, when it&#x27;s time for a live virtual class, many are forced to send their students to an external, generic video conferencing link. This experience is often disjointed, and the tools provided are frequently limited to passive screen sharing.</p>
<p>What if your live classroom felt like a native part of Moodle? What if you could move beyond one-way screen sharing to a truly interactive and collaborative canvas, all while maintaining the highest levels of security and performance?</p>
<p>By integrating the <strong>plugNmeet</strong> activity module into Moodle, you can achieve exactly that.

<p>When we designed plugNmeet, we had a clear set of goals: the platform needed to be high-performance, horizontally scalable, resilient, and easy for developers to build upon. This led us to make two fundamental decisions for our backend: we chose <strong>LiveKit</strong> for our media server and <strong>NATS</strong> for our real-time messaging layer.</p>
