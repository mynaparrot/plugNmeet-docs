Think about the last time a new application asked you to "download and install" something. A small wave of hesitation probably washed over you. Is this software safe? Will it slow down my computer? Do I have time for this? It's a moment of friction and uncertainty.

At plugNmeet, we believe that joining a video meeting should be as simple and frictionless as visiting a website. That's why we've built our entire platform around a core philosophy: **No installation required.**

This isn't just a convenience; it's a deliberate design choice that leads to a more secure, more private, and fundamentally better user experience for everyone.

## The Power of the Modern Web Browser

Your web browser—whether it's Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari—is an incredibly powerful piece of software. Think of it as a secure "Swiss Army knife" for the internet, equipped with advanced tools for communication, security, and storage.

Instead of asking you to download a separate, standalone application, we decided to leverage the powerful tools that are **already built into your browser.** This approach has three huge benefits.

### 1. Unmatched Simplicity and Accessibility

This is the most obvious benefit. With plugNmeet, you join a meeting by clicking a link. That's it.

*   **No Downloads, No Delays:** You never have to download an `.exe` or `.dmg` file. You're in the meeting in seconds.
*   **Always Up-to-Date:** You are always using the latest, most secure version of the software without ever having to click an "update" button.
*   **It Just Works, Everywhere:** If you have a modern web browser, you can use plugNmeet. It works on almost any computer without worrying about compatibility issues.

### 2. Gold-Standard Security, Built-In

You might think a standalone app is more secure, but often the opposite is true. Modern browsers have world-class security teams behind them and come with powerful, built-in encryption tools.

We use these tools to offer **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**.

In simple terms, E2EE scrambles your video and audio the moment it leaves your computer and only unscrambles it when it reaches the other participants. Not even our server can see or hear the content of your conversation.

By using the browser's native encryption capabilities, we can provide this "gold-standard" security without requiring you to install any extra security software. The protection is already there, and we simply turn it on.

### 3. A Smarter, More Private Experience

Your browser also has a small, private storage space that belongs only to you. We use this to temporarily remember your in-meeting activity.

As we explained in a previous post, this is how we can restore your chat history and whiteboard drawings if you accidentally refresh the page.

This data lives **only on your computer** and is deleted when you properly leave the meeting. By using your browser's own storage, we don't have to save this sensitive session data on our servers. It's a simple way we deliver a better experience while fiercely protecting your privacy.

## Conclusion: The Best Technology is Invisible

Our "no installation" philosophy is about more than just convenience. It's about respecting your time, your security, and your privacy.

By building on the powerful, secure foundation of the modern web browser, we can deliver a seamless experience that just works. We believe the best technology is the kind you don't even have to think about. You click a link, and you're there. It's that simple.
