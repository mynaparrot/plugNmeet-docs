Today marks a new chapter for the plugNmeet project. We are incredibly excited to launch our new, official blog, right here on our own domain: `plugnmeet.org`.

For those of you who have followed us on Medium, thank you. Your support has been invaluable. But as our community has grown, we knew it was time to build our own homeâ€”a space that truly reflects the values of our project.

The decision to move our blog wasn't just about having a new design. It was about philosophy.

### Why We Moved: Practicing What We Preach

The core promise of plugNmeet is simple: **you should be in control.**

We built plugNmeet because we believe that your conversations are too important to be entrusted to a third-party platform. You should own your data, control your brand, and manage your own infrastructure. We provide the tools for you to build your own private, powerful communication platform.

So, it was only natural that we apply the same principle to our own content.

Publishing on a third-party platform like Medium is convenient, but it means you are building your house on someone else's land. The platform controls the experience, owns the relationship with your audience, and ultimately benefits the most from the value you create.

We decided it was time to own our content, just as we empower you to own your conversations. By moving our blog to our own self-hosted Docusaurus site, we are:

1.  **Consolidating Our SEO:** All the authority we build now flows directly to `plugnmeet.org`, making our project's home the definitive source of truth.
2.  **Owning Our Brand:** The look, feel, and user experience are now 100% ours, creating a seamless journey from our blog to our documentation.
3.  **Living Our Philosophy:** We are demonstrating the power and importance of self-hosting in a real, tangible way.

### What to Expect from This Blog

This new space will be the heart of the plugNmeet community and knowledge base. It's where we will share not just announcements, but deep, valuable content designed to help you succeed. Expect to see:

*   **Technical Deep Dives:** Detailed articles on our architecture, from our pragmatic approach to scaling to the specifics of our security model.
*   **Practical Guides & Case Studies:** Real-world examples of how businesses, educators, and developers are using plugNmeet to solve their communication challenges.
*   **Product Updates:** The latest news on new features, releases, and the future roadmap of the project.

Our goal is to create a resource that is as powerful and flexible as the platform itself.

### Join Us on the Journey

Thank you for being a part of the plugNmeet community. This new blog is for you, and we're excited to start this next chapter together. We believe in a future where everyone has the power to create their own private, secure, and branded spaces for communication.

Welcome to our new home.
