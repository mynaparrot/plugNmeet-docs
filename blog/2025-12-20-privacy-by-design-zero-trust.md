In an era where data breaches are daily news and "free" services monetize your conversations, privacy can no longer be an afterthought. It must be the foundation.

When we built Plug-N-Meet, we didn't just want to create another video conferencing tool. We wanted to build a platform that respects the user's right to privacy by default. This meant making hard architectural choices—prioritizing security over easy data harvesting, and giving control back to the user rather than hoarding it on the server.

If you are building a telehealth platform, a legal consultation app, or simply a secure meeting space for your team, you need more than just a "secure" sticker. You need an architecture designed for the Zero-Trust era.

Here is how Plug-N-Meet delivers on that promise.

## 1. The Gold Standard: True Zero-Trust E2EE

Most video platforms claim to be "secure" because they use encryption in transit (TLS/DTLS). While this protects your data from hackers on the coffee shop Wi-Fi, it has a major flaw: the server itself still decrypts your video to process it. This means the service provider (and anyone who hacks them) can see and hear everything.

Plug-N-Meet offers a **Zero-Trust** alternative: **User-Provided Key End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**.

When you enable this mode (`enabled_self_insert_encryption_key: true`), the encryption keys are generated by the participants and shared directly between them (e.g., via a password manager or secure chat). **These keys never leave the user's device.**

*   **The Result:** The server only relays encrypted packets. It mathematically cannot decrypt the video or audio.
*   **The Benefit:** You achieve true "Zero Knowledge" privacy. Even if the server is compromised, your meetings remain a black box.

## 2. Data Minimization & Ephemeral Storage

A core principle of modern privacy (and regulations like GDPR) is **Data Minimization**: don't collect what you don't need, and don't keep it longer than necessary.

Plug-N-Meet is designed with **ephemeral storage** at its core:

*   **Volatile Session State:** Active meeting data (who is in the room, who is muted) lives in high-performance, in-memory stores like Redis or NATS KV. When the meeting ends, this data is naturally cleared.
*   **Client-Side History:** Chat history and user preferences are stored in the user's own browser using `IndexedDB`, not permanently on our servers. This puts the user in control of their own data footprint.
*   **Granular Analytics:** You have the power to disable analytics entirely (`enable_analytics: false`) or configure the system to store only metadata (e.g., "User A spoke for 5 minutes") without ever recording the content of what was said.

## 3. The NATS Advantage: Protocol-Level Access Control

Many web applications rely solely on application-level logic (e.g., `if (user.isAdmin)`) to check if a user should see a message. If that logic has a bug, data leaks.

Plug-N-Meet takes a more robust approach by leveraging the powerful security features of **NATS JetStream** to enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

*   **Dynamic Permissions:** When a user joins, the system generates a custom set of NATS permissions specific to that user's session.
*   **Protocol Enforcement:** These permissions are enforced by the NATS server itself, not just the Plug-N-Meet application code.
*   **The Result:** A participant literally **cannot** subscribe to a data stream they aren't authorized for. Even if a modified client tries to "listen in" on another room or a private chat, the NATS server will reject the subscription request at the protocol level.

This provides a hard security boundary that is rare in self-hosted web conferencing tools, ensuring that data isolation is enforced by the infrastructure, not just the code.

## 4. Defense-in-Depth Security

Privacy relies on security, and security requires layers. Beyond NATS and E2EE, we employ multiple other safeguards:

*   **Token-Based Access:** Every user joins with a short-lived, one-time-use token. This prevents "replay attacks" where a hacker tries to reuse an old link to crash a meeting.
*   **Salted Key Derivation:** As detailed in our [Security Overview](/docs/security-overview), we use the unique `session_id` as a salt when deriving encryption keys. This ensures that even if a room ID is reused, every single session has a unique, cryptographically isolated key.

## 5. Privacy-Aware AI

Integrating AI into meetings is powerful, but it's often a privacy nightmare. We've solved this with a "Privacy First" integration strategy.

The system is designed to be **context-aware**. If you enable End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) with a user-provided key, Plug-N-Meet **automatically disables** all audio-based AI features (like transcription and recording).

Why? Because the AI bot on the server cannot decrypt the audio stream. This prevents the dangerous scenario where a user *thinks* they are in a secure, private meeting, but an AI service is silently listening in the background. With Plug-N-Meet, if you choose maximum privacy, the system enforces it across the board.

## 6. The Ultimate Privacy Feature: Self-Hosting

Finally, the most important privacy feature of Plug-N-Meet is that **you own it**.

*   **No Black Boxes:** Because the code is open source, it can be audited. There are no hidden "telemetry" trackers sending your data back to a headquarters.
*   **Your Infrastructure, Your Rules:** You aren't renting privacy from a third-party SaaS provider. You host the server, you control the database, and you own the logs.

## Conclusion

In a world of surveillance capitalism, privacy is a competitive advantage. Whether you are building for healthcare (HIPAA), education (FERPA), or enterprise security, Plug-N-Meet provides a foundation that doesn't just "support" privacy—it enforces it.

By combining Zero-Trust E2EE, protocol-level access control, and the transparency of open source, we've built a platform where you don't have to trust us. You just have to trust the code.
