How many times have you been in an online meeting where the presenter says, "Okay, I'm going to share my screen now... wait, let me find the right tab... can you all see this? Now, let me switch to this other tab..."?

This constant switching, sharing, and re-sharing breaks the flow, distracts participants, and turns what should be a dynamic collaboration into a clunky, disjointed experience. Your meeting becomes a series of disconnected windows, not a unified workspace.

At Plug-N-Meet, we believe your meeting room should be as versatile as your web browser. That's why we built the **"Share External Link"** feature, allowing you to seamlessly display any website or web application directly within your meeting, transforming it into a truly interactive and engaging environment.

### The Problem: The Friction of Tab-Switching

Traditional screen sharing is great for showing a static document or a single application. But modern collaboration often involves multiple web-based tools: a project management board, a shared document, a live dashboard, or even an interactive poll.

Trying to manage these by constantly sharing and unsharing your screen is inefficient and frustrating. It pulls participants out of the meeting context and makes it hard to maintain focus.

### The Solution: Your Meeting, Your Web Browser

The "Share External Link" feature solves this by turning your meeting's main stage into a dynamic web viewer. A moderator can simply paste a URL, and that website or web application instantly appears for all participants, right within the Plug-N-Meet interface.

**How it Works (Simple Steps):**

1.  As a moderator, click the "More Options" menu (...) in the control bar.
2.  Select **"Share External Link."**
3.  Paste the URL of the website or web application you wish to share.
4.  The content will immediately load and be visible to everyone in the meeting.

*(Note: For security reasons, the external website must allow itself to be embedded in an iframe. Most modern web applications are configured this way.)*

### Powerful Use Cases: Transform Your Meetings

This simple feature unlocks a world of possibilities for more dynamic and productive meetings:

*   **Collaborative Document Editing:** Work on a Google Doc, Notion page, or a shared project management board (like Trello or Asana) together in real-time. Everyone sees the same content, and the moderator can even allow participants to interact with it directly.
*   **Interactive Presentations & Training:** Embed a live poll, a quiz from a learning platform, or an interactive data visualization directly into your presentation flow. No need to send participants to a separate link; everything happens within the meeting.
*   **Design & Code Reviews:** Display a live Figma or Miro board for real-time feedback, or review a code repository together, making annotations and discussions seamless.
*   **Onboarding & Support:** Walk new hires through an online HR portal, a software demo, or a customer support ticket system directly within the meeting, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
*   **Virtual Tours & Interactive Content:** Share a collaborative online game, or a virtual tour to make your meetings more engaging and interactive.

### Moderator Control, Seamless Experience

The moderator retains full control over what web content is displayed and when, ensuring the meeting stays focused. Participants remain within the familiar Plug-N-Meet environment, reducing distractions and improving overall engagement. It's about bringing the tools to the conversation, not sending the conversation to the tools.

### Conclusion: Your Meeting, Your Dynamic Workspace

The "Share External Link" feature transforms your Plug-N-Meet room from a simple video call into a versatile, dynamic workspace. It allows you to integrate the vast resources of the web directly into your collaboration, making your presentations more engaging, your discussions more productive, and your overall meeting experience far more seamless.

Stop switching tabs. Start collaborating dynamically.
