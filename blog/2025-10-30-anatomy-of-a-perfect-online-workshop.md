We've all been there: an "interactive workshop" that's just a 90-minute video call with a slide deck. The host struggles to juggle different apps for polls, group activities, and notes, while the audience slowly disengages.

An online workshop shouldn't be a passive presentation. It should be a dynamic, collaborative experience. But to achieve that, you need more than just a video link; you need an integrated toolkit where every feature works together seamlessly.

With Plug-N-Meet, you have that toolkit. This guide will walk you through the anatomy of a perfect online workshop, showing how to use a single, unified platform to manage every stage of your event, from the initial icebreaker to the automated follow-up.

### Step 1: The Blueprint - Setting Up Your Workshop for Success

A great workshop starts with the right environment. When you create your Plug-N-Meet room, you're not just creating a call; you're setting the stage. Using the API or the dashboard, you can pre-configure the room specifically for interaction:

*   **Enable Breakout Rooms:** Check the box to allow breakout rooms, ready for your group activities.
*   **Activate the Whiteboard:** Ensure the interactive whiteboard is enabled for visual collaboration.
*   **Keep it Open:** Unlike a formal webinar, you might start with microphones and webcams unlocked to encourage participation from the very beginning.
*   **Set Up Your Automation:** Provide a `webhook_url` during room creation. This is the secret ingredient for our automated follow-up later.

### Step 2: The Icebreaker - A Visual Welcome

Forget the awkward "let's go around and say our names" in the chat. A great workshop starts with immediate, visual engagement.

**The Activity:** Use the **Interactive Whiteboard** for a simple icebreaker. Upload an image of a world map. As participants join, enable **multi-user drawing mode** and ask everyone to place a dot or their name on the city they're joining from.

In seconds, you've created a visual, interactive representation of your audience. It's a simple, powerful way to get everyone engaged and comfortable with the tools from the very first minute.

### Step 3: The Core Activity - Deep Collaboration in Breakout Rooms

Now for the heart of the workshop. You announce, "We're going to split into groups of four to brainstorm solutions."

With Plug-N-Meet, this is effortless:

1.  The host opens the **Breakout Rooms** management panel.
2.  They choose the number of rooms and the duration (e.g., "15 minutes").
3.  They can drag and drop participants into specific rooms or click **"Randomly Assign"** to have Plug-N-Meet do the work.

The magic is what happens *inside* these rooms. Unlike other platforms where advanced features disappear, each breakout room in Plug-N-Meet gets its own **fully functional, private interactive whiteboard and shared notepad.**

Your groups can now brainstorm on their own canvas, create their own notes, and collaborate deeply without being distracted by the main session. As a host, you can even send a broadcast message to all rooms ("5 minutes left!") or pop into a specific room to see how they're doing.

### Step 4: The Debrief - Gathering Insights with Live Polls

The breakout session timer ends, and everyone is automatically brought back to the main room. How do you efficiently gather the key takeaways from each group?

This is the perfect moment for a **Live Poll**.

The host creates a new poll on the fly: "Which proposed solution did your group find most promising?" with several options. As participants vote, the host sees the results update in real-time. Once the voting is closed, the host can click **"Publish Results,"** which sends a clean, graphical summary to the public chat for everyone to see and discuss. It's a structured, democratic, and highly efficient way to debrief.

### Step 5: The Follow-Up - Smart, Automated Summaries

The workshop was a huge success. Now what? Manually downloading the recording, uploading it somewhere, and emailing a link to all attendees is a tedious, error-prone process.

This is where the `webhook_url` you set up in Step 1 comes into play.

1.  The host clicks **"End Recording."**
2.  A few minutes later, once the recording file is processed and ready, the Plug-N-Meet server automatically sends a notification (a webhook) to your server.
3.  Your system, listening for this `end_recording` event, receives a payload with the link to the downloadable MP4 file.
4.  Your server can then automatically trigger a pre-written email to all registered workshop attendees with a thank-you message and the link to the recording.

The host does nothing. The follow-up is instant, professional, and completely automated.

### Conclusion: An Integrated Toolkit for True Collaboration

A successful online workshop isn't about having a dozen different tools; it's about having the *right* tools that work together in harmony.

From the initial setup and interactive icebreaker, through the deep collaboration in breakout rooms, to the structured polling and automated follow-up, Plug-N-Meet provides a single, integrated platform designed for one purpose: to help you create more engaging, effective, and professional online events.
