        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As an educator or administrator on Moodle, your goal is to create a seamless and engaging learning environment. But when it's time for a live virtual class, many are forced to compromise, sending students to an external Zoom or Teams link. This breaks the learning flow, creates a disjointed user experience, and raises valid concerns about student data privacy.</p>
<p>What if your virtual classroom was just another native Moodle activity, as easy to add as a quiz or a forum? What if it was a powerful, interactive space designed specifically for teaching, not just a generic meeting room?</p>
<p>With the official <strong>Plug-N-Meet plugin for Moodle</strong>, this is not just possible; it's simple. This guide will show you how to transform your Moodle site into a world-class, interactive e-learning platform.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="why-a-native-moodle-integration-is-a-game-changer">Why a Native Moodle Integration is a Game-Changer<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/moodle-video-conferencing-guide#why-a-native-moodle-integration-is-a-game-changer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why a Native Moodle Integration is a Game-Changer" title="Direct link to Why a Native Moodle Integration is a Game-Changer" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Before we get to the "how," let's focus on the "why." Choosing a deeply integrated, self-hosted solution like Plug-N-Meet over a generic SaaS tool provides three critical advantages for any educational institution.</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>A Seamless Student Experience:</strong> Students never leave your Moodle site. They join the live class directly from their course page, with the same branding and interface they already know. This reduces confusion and keeps them focused on the learning, not the technology.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Absolute Control Over Student Data:</strong> In education, privacy is paramount. With a self-hosted platform, all student data and class recordings are stored on your own servers, not on a third-party cloud. This gives you full control to ensure compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR and FERPA.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Predictable, Scalable Costs:</strong> Instead of paying a costly per-host, per-month subscription that penalizes you for adding more teachers, you have a fixed, predictable cost for your server infrastructure. This is a far more sustainable and cost-effective model for schools and universities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Getting started is incredibly fast. You can have your first meeting room live in under 15 minutes. For a more detailed walkthrough, you can also read our popular guide on <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/no-code-video-conferencing-moodle">How to Add No-Code Video Conferencing to Your Moodle Courses</a></strong>.</p>

<p>First, you need the server that will power your video calls. You can either self-host the open-source version with our <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/docs/installation">simple installation script</a></strong> or get an instant, managed server from <strong><a href="https://www.plugnmeet.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">plugnmeet Cloud</a></strong>. Both will provide you with an <strong>API Key</strong> and <strong>API Secret</strong>.</p>

<p>From your Moodle Site Administration panel:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">Go to <strong>Site administration &gt; Plugins &gt; Install plugins</strong>.</li>
<li class="">Install the Plug-N-Meet plugin, which you can download from the official <a href="https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_plugnmeet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Moodle plugins directory</a>.</li>
<li class="">After installation, navigate to the plugin settings page (<strong>Site administration &gt; Plugins &gt; Activity modules &gt; PlugNmeet</strong>).</li>
<li class="">Enter your <strong>API Key</strong> and <strong>API Secret</strong> and save the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Moodle site is now fully integrated with your video conferencing engine.</p>

<ol>
<li class="">Navigate to the Moodle course where you want to add the live class.</li>
<li class="">Turn <strong>Edit mode</strong> on.</li>
<li class="">Click <strong>Add an activity or resource</strong> and select <strong>PlugNmeet</strong> from the list.</li>
<li class="">Configure your virtual classroom, giving it a name, a welcome message, and setting the schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Your students can now join a powerful, interactive virtual classroom directly from their Moodle course page.</p>

<p>Plug-N-Meet is more than just a lecture tool. It's a suite of features designed for modern pedagogy.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="use-case-1-the-interactive-virtual-classroom">Use Case 1: The Interactive Virtual Classroom<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/moodle-video-conferencing-guide#use-case-1-the-interactive-virtual-classroom" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Use Case 1: The Interactive Virtual Classroom" title="Direct link to Use Case 1: The Interactive Virtual Classroom" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Transform a passive lecture into an engaging, two-way experience.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>How to do it:</strong> Use the <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience">Interactive Whiteboard</a></strong> to upload your presentation slides and annotate them in real-time. Use the <strong>Live Polling</strong> feature to quickly check for student understanding or run a quick quiz. All class sessions can be recorded to the cloud and automatically made available back in the Moodle course for students who missed the live session.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="use-case-2-the-collaborative-workshop-with-breakout-rooms">Use Case 2: The Collaborative Workshop with Breakout Rooms<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/moodle-video-conferencing-guide#use-case-2-the-collaborative-workshop-with-breakout-rooms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Use Case 2: The Collaborative Workshop with Breakout Rooms" title="Direct link to Use Case 2: The Collaborative Workshop with Breakout Rooms" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>For project-based learning and group work, the <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/mastering-breakout-rooms">Breakout Rooms</a></strong> feature is essential.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>How to do it:</strong> From within the live session, the teacher can split the students into smaller groups. Each breakout room gets its own private, fully-functional whiteboard and shared notepad, allowing for true small-group collaboration. The teacher can broadcast messages to all rooms or drop in to a specific group to check on their progress.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="use-case-3-the-secure-one-on-one-or-parent-teacher-conference">Use Case 3: The Secure One-on-One or Parent-Teacher Conference<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/moodle-video-conferencing-guide#use-case-3-the-secure-one-on-one-or-parent-teacher-conference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Use Case 3: The Secure One-on-One or Parent-Teacher Conference" title="Direct link to Use Case 3: The Secure One-on-One or Parent-Teacher Conference" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>For private conversations, you need a higher level of security.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>How to do it:</strong> Create a PlugNmeet activity and, in the room settings, enable <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/privacy-by-design-zero-trust">End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)</a></strong>. This provides a mathematical guarantee that the conversation is completely private and that not even the server administrator can access the audio or video. This is ideal for one-on-one student support, counseling sessions, or parent-teacher conferences where confidentiality is critical.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="conclusion-the-virtual-classroom-moodle-deserves">Conclusion: The Virtual Classroom Moodle Deserves<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/moodle-video-conferencing-guide#conclusion-the-virtual-classroom-moodle-deserves" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion: The Virtual Classroom Moodle Deserves" title="Direct link to Conclusion: The Virtual Classroom Moodle Deserves" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Stop compromising with external tools that break the learning experience. By integrating Plug-N-Meet, you can offer your teachers and students a powerful, secure, and seamlessly integrated virtual classroom that lives right where it belongs: inside Moodle.</p>
<p>It's a solution that's simple enough for any teacher to use but powerful enough to support the most innovative online teaching methods.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WordPress has empowered millions to build anything from a simple blog to a complex e-commerce empire. But when it comes to one of the most critical forms of modern communication—live video—many site owners hit a wall. You're often left juggling clunky Zoom links, sending your users to third-party platforms, and sacrificing the professional, branded experience your website was designed to provide.</p>
<p>What if you could integrate a powerful, secure, and fully-branded video conferencing solution directly into your WordPress site as easily as you add a new page?</p>
<p>This is not just possible; it's simple. This guide will show you how to use the <strong>Plug-N-Meet plugin</strong> to transform your WordPress site into a true communication hub, whether you need a simple meeting room, a platform for webinars, or a full-fledged, monetized video service.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="why-self-hosted-is-the-smart-choice-for-wordpress">Why Self-Hosted is the Smart Choice for WordPress<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/wordpress-video-conferencing-guide#why-self-hosted-is-the-smart-choice-for-wordpress" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Self-Hosted is the Smart Choice for WordPress" title="Direct link to Why Self-Hosted is the Smart Choice for WordPress" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Before we dive into the "how," let's cover the "why." While embedding a Zoom meeting is an option, a self-hosted solution like Plug-N-Meet offers three transformative advantages for any serious WordPress site owner:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>You Own Your Brand:</strong> Every meeting happens on your own domain, with your logo and your colors. You're not providing free advertising for a SaaS giant; you're reinforcing your own brand's professionalism and trust.</li>
<li class=""><strong>You Control Your Data:</strong> All data—from user information to recordings—stays on your own server. This gives you absolute control over privacy and is critical for compliance in sensitive industries.</li>
<li class=""><strong>You Escape Per-User Pricing:</strong> Instead of paying a fee for every host on your team, you have a predictable, fixed cost for your server. This model rewards your growth instead of penalizing it.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-3-step-guide-to-your-first-wordpress-meeting">The 3-Step Guide to Your First WordPress Meeting<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/wordpress-video-conferencing-guide#the-3-step-guide-to-your-first-wordpress-meeting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The 3-Step Guide to Your First WordPress Meeting" title="Direct link to The 3-Step Guide to Your First WordPress Meeting" translate="no">​</a></h3>

<li class="">Navigate to the new <strong>Plug-N-Meet &gt; Settings</strong> menu.</li>
<li class="">Enter your <strong>API Key</strong> and <strong>API Secret</strong> and save.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your WordPress site is now fully integrated with your video conferencing engine.</p>

<ol>
<li class="">Go to <strong>Plug-N-Meet &gt; Rooms</strong> and click <strong>Add New</strong>.</li>
<li class="">Configure your room's features (e.g., name, max participants, welcome message) and get the <strong>Room ID</strong>.</li>
<li class="">After saving, the plugin will generate a unique <strong>Shortcode</strong> for that room (e.g., <code>[plugnmeet_room_view id="your_room_id"]</code>).</li>
<li class="">Create a new WordPress Page, paste the shortcode into the content, and click <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. You now have a fully functional, branded video conferencing room running directly on your own website.</p>

<p>Once you've mastered the basics, you can leverage Plug-N-Meet to power a wide range of professional services.</p>

<p>Are you a coach, consultant, or therapist? You can easily create secure, private rooms for your client sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>How to do it:</strong> Create a separate, password-protected page for each client. Embed the shortcode for a unique meeting room on that page. Only the person with the password can access the session, ensuring complete privacy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="use-case-2-the-community-webinar-or-live-event">Use Case 2: The Community Webinar or Live Event<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/wordpress-video-conferencing-guide#use-case-2-the-community-webinar-or-live-event" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Use Case 2: The Community Webinar or Live Event" title="Direct link to Use Case 2: The Community Webinar or Live Event" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Want to host a webinar for your audience? Plug-N-Meet is a powerful open-source webinar platform.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>How to do it:</strong> Create a room and configure its features specifically for a webinar. In the room settings, you can disable webcams and microphones for attendees by default, enable <strong>Cloud Recording</strong>, and use features like <strong>Polling</strong> and <strong>Raise Hand</strong> to manage audience interaction. Embed the room's shortcode on your "Events" page and you're ready to go live.</li>

<p>This is where you can turn your video feature into a revenue stream. By combining Plug-N-Meet with a popular membership plugin (like Paid Memberships Pro, MemberPress, or Restrict Content Pro), you can create premium video content exclusively for paying subscribers. For a detailed walkthrough of this business model, see our guide on <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/no-code-video-conferencing-service-with-wordpress">How to Launch Your Own No-Code Video Conferencing Service with WordPress</a></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>How to do it:</strong>
<ol>
<li class="">Use your membership plugin to create a "Premium" subscription tier.</li>
<li class="">Create a new WordPress page for your premium content (e.g., "Weekly Mastermind Call").</li>
<li class="">Paste the Plug-N-Meet room shortcode onto this page.</li>
<li class="">Use your membership plugin's settings to <strong>restrict access</strong> to this page so that only users with an active "Premium" subscription can view it.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Plug-N-Meet WordPress plugin isn't just for basic meetings. It gives you simple, one-click access to enterprise-grade features directly from your room settings.</p>

This ensures that not even your server can access the meeting's content.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You've successfully integrated Plug-N-Meet into your application. You can create rooms, generate join tokens, and embed the client in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. It's fast and it works. But now you want to go deeper. You want to break out of the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> box and build a truly seamless user experience where the video client feels like a native part of your application's UI.</p>
<p>This is where Plug-N-Meet's "headless" integration mode comes in.</p>
<p>This guide is for developers who want to move beyond basic embedding. We'll show you how to use the powerful <code>getClientFiles</code> API to render the Plug-N-Meet client directly into your own page's DOM, giving you ultimate control over layout, branding, and the user experience.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-problem-with-iframes">The Problem with Iframes<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/developer-guide-custom-video-chat-ui-headless-api#the-problem-with-iframes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Problem with Iframes" title="Direct link to The Problem with Iframes" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>An <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is a simple way to embed content, but it's essentially a "window" into another website. This creates several limitations for developers aiming for a professional, deeply integrated product:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Black Box:</strong> The <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> creates a hard boundary between your parent application and the video client, making communication between them complex and limited.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Layout Restrictions:</strong> You are stuck with the layout provided by the <code>src</code> URL. You can't easily place your own application's components (like a custom header or a sidebar with user data) "inside" the video experience.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Styling and Branding:</strong> While you can pass some branding parameters, your ability to deeply customize the look and feel is limited.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-solution-headless-integration-with-getclientfiles">The Solution: Headless Integration with <code>getClientFiles</code><a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/developer-guide-custom-video-chat-ui-headless-api#the-solution-headless-integration-with-getclientfiles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-solution-headless-integration-with-getclientfiles" title="Direct link to the-solution-headless-integration-with-getclientfiles" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The <code>getClientFiles</code> API is the key to unlocking a truly "headless" video integration. Instead of providing you with a URL to embed, it gives you a list of the exact CSS and JavaScript assets you need to render the client yourself.</p>
<p>This approach transforms Plug-N-Meet from a separate application into a UI component library that you control.</p>

<p>The logic is simple and can be implemented in any backend language (PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.).</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Your Backend Fetches the Asset List:</strong> Your server makes a secure, server-to-server API call to the <code>/auth/getClientFiles</code> endpoint.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Plug-N-Meet Responds with a JSON Object:</strong> This object contains two arrays: <code>css</code> and <code>js</code>, listing the filenames of all the necessary assets.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Your Template Renders the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> Tags:</strong> Your server-side templating engine loops through these arrays and dynamically injects the required tags into the HTML page that will be sent to the user's browser.</li>

<p>When a user visits <code>/meeting</code>, they will see your application's custom header and sidebar, with the Plug-N-Meet video client rendered seamlessly in the middle. The client will be styled with the dynamic brand colors you passed from the backend.</p>
<p>You have successfully broken out of the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> box.</p>
<p>From here, the possibilities are endless. You can use your own application's state to interact with the meeting, build custom layouts that respond to meeting events, and create a user experience that is completely unique to your product.</p>
<p>This is the true power of a headless, API-first platform. It gives you the building blocks not just to add a feature, but to build a deeply integrated and professional product.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your video service is a hit. User numbers are climbing, and engagement is high. But as you celebrate your success, a new problem emerges: your server bill is exploding. To keep up with demand, you keep buying bigger and bigger servers, paying a premium for resources that sit idle most of the day.</p>
<p>What went wrong? You've fallen into the monolith trap.</p>
<p>This post explains how Plug-N-Meet's modern, decoupled architecture is designed to prevent this exact problem, enabling you to scale your service efficiently and control your costs. For a business, this isn't just a technical detail—it's a core financial advantage.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-monolith-trap-paying-for-empty-seats">The Monolith Trap: Paying for Empty Seats<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/scaling-architecture-saves-money#the-monolith-trap-paying-for-empty-seats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Monolith Trap: Paying for Empty Seats" title="Direct link to The Monolith Trap: Paying for Empty Seats" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Many traditional video conferencing platforms are built as <strong>monoliths</strong>. This means the core application, the media processing, and the recording services are all bundled into a single, massive application.</p>
<p>This creates a huge problem when it's time to scale:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>If you need to support more concurrent users</strong>, you have to upgrade the <em>entire</em> server, even if your recording service is barely being used.</li>
<li class=""><strong>If a few large recording jobs are using all the CPU</strong>, your live meetings will lag and stutter, forcing you to buy a bigger server just to handle a temporary workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>A monolithic server is like renting a giant bus for a single passenger. You pay for all the empty seats, and if one part of the bus breaks down, the whole trip is canceled.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-plug-n-meet-way-a-decoupled-intelligent-architecture">The Plug-N-Meet Way: A Decoupled, Intelligent Architecture<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/scaling-architecture-saves-money#the-plug-n-meet-way-a-decoupled-intelligent-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Plug-N-Meet Way: A Decoupled, Intelligent Architecture" title="Direct link to The Plug-N-Meet Way: A Decoupled, Intelligent Architecture" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Plug-N-Meet was designed from the ground up to avoid this trap. It is not one giant application; it is a set of specialized, independent services that work together.</p>
<p>The three core components are:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong><code>plugnmeet-server</code> (The Brain):</strong> A lightweight Go application that handles all the API calls, authentication, and business logic.</li>
<li class=""><strong><code>LiveKit</code> (The Media Highway):</strong> A high-performance, open-source media server that manages all the real-time audio and video traffic.</li>
<li class=""><strong><code>plugnmeet-recorder</code> (The Factory):</strong> A dedicated Go application that handles CPU-intensive tasks like MP4 recording and RTMP broadcasting.</li>
</ol>
<p>These components are designed to be scaled <strong>independently</strong>. This is the key to cost-effective growth.</p>

<p>With a decoupled architecture, you can scale each component based on your actual needs.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Expecting a huge webinar?</strong> You don't need to touch your main application server. Simply spin up a few extra <code>LiveKit</code> media servers for the duration of the event, then spin them down afterward.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Seeing more users in a specific region?</strong> Deploy media servers in that geographic area to reduce latency, without having to replicate your entire backend.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is like adding more cashiers to a store only during the holiday rush. You get the performance you need when you need it, and you don't pay for idle resources during quiet periods.</p>

<p>In a monolith, a resource-hungry task can degrade the entire user experience. If someone starts a large recording, everyone's live video call could suffer.</p>
<p>Plug-N-Meet's architecture prevents this. Because the <code>plugnmeet-recorder</code> is a separate service, you can run it on entirely different machines from your live media servers.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Result:</strong> A CPU-intensive MP4 transcoding job will have <strong>zero impact</strong> on the quality and stability of your live meetings.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Benefit:</strong> Your users always get a smooth, high-quality experience, which is critical for customer satisfaction and retention.</li>

<p>"Scalable" isn't just a technical buzzword; it's a business feature. The ability to scale components independently and isolate workloads means you are not constantly over-provisioning your hardware. You pay only for the resources you actually use.</p>
<p>As your platform grows, this intelligent design leads to a dramatically <strong>lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)</strong> compared to a monolithic solution. You can grow your user base sustainably without your infrastructure costs spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>Plug-N-Meet's architecture isn't just a technical implementation detail; it's a strategic advantage designed to help your business succeed at scale.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For many platforms, the "record" button is the end of the story. You get an MP4 file, and that's it. But what if your recordings could be more? What if they could be a structured, searchable, and accessible content library for your students, your team, or your customers?</p>
<p>With Plug-N-Meet's powerful API, your recordings aren't just video files; they are programmable assets.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to move beyond simply recording a meeting and start building a true content management system using the Recordings API. We'll cover how to find your recordings, enrich them with metadata, and even attach subtitles.</p>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will be able to programmatically manage your entire recording lifecycle, turning a simple list of video files into a rich, queryable content library.</p>

<li class="">A running Plug-N-Meet server.</li>
<li class="">Basic familiarity with making API calls (we'll use <code>cURL</code> for the examples).</li>

<p>First, you need to ensure your meetings are being recorded. You can do this on a per-room basis when you create it. In your <code>createRoom</code> API call, include the <code>recording_features</code> block and set <code>is_allow_cloud</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>For a "record by default" experience, you can also enable <code>enable_auto_cloud_recording</code>.</p>

<p>After your meetings are over, the first step is to get a list of your available recordings. You can do this using the <code>recording/fetch</code> endpoint. You can fetch recordings for one or more specific rooms by providing their IDs in the <code>room_ids</code> array.</p>
<p>This call will return a paginated list of all recordings for the specified room(s).</p>

<p>A filename like <code>rec_123.mp4</code> isn't very helpful. To make your recordings useful, you need to add context. The <code>recording/update-metadata</code> endpoint allows you to add a descriptive title, a detailed description, and even your own custom data.</p>
<p>Let's say you just finished a "Q4 Marketing Sync" and you want to tag it appropriately.</p>

<p>Now, when you fetch this recording, it will come with rich, structured data. You can use the <code>extra_data</code> field to build powerful filtering and search features in your own application (e.g., "show me all recordings from the Marketing department").</p>

<p>Stop thinking of your recordings as a simple archive. With Plug-N-Meet's API-first approach, you have the tools to build a sophisticated, searchable, and accessible content management system.</p>
<p>By programmatically fetching, enriching, and linking your recordings with other assets, you can transform a simple folder of MP4 files into a powerful knowledge base for your organization.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've all been there: a crucial meeting is about to start, but a key participant has a spotty internet connection, is traveling, or simply doesn't have access to a computer. In a world increasingly reliant on video calls, how do you ensure everyone can still participate, even if they can't join online?</p>
<p>At Plug-N-Meet, we believe in inclusivity. That's why we're excited to introduce <strong>SIP Dial-In</strong>, a powerful feature that allows participants to join the audio of your video meetings using any standard telephone. No internet, no problem.</p>
<p>This feature seamlessly bridges the gap between your online conference and the traditional telephone network, ensuring that every voice can be heard, regardless of their connectivity.</p>

<p>While WebRTC-based video conferencing is incredibly powerful, it relies on a stable internet connection. This can be a barrier for:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Travelers:</strong> On the road, in a car, or in areas with poor Wi-Fi.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Remote Locations:</strong> Participants in regions with limited internet infrastructure.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Accessibility Needs:</strong> Individuals who prefer or require telephone access.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Simple Audio-Only Participation:</strong> Sometimes, all you need is to listen and speak, without the video.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our SIP Dial-In feature integrates your Plug-N-Meet meetings with the global telephone network. It works by setting up a <strong>SIP Gateway</strong> that acts as a bridge, allowing traditional phone calls to connect directly into your online conference.</p>

<p>Under the hood, Plug-N-Meet leverages the robust <strong><a href="https://github.com/livekit/sip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">livekit/sip</a></strong> project as its SIP gateway. This component is responsible for managing the connection between your meeting and an external SIP trunking provider.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="for-administrators-server-setup-is-key">For Administrators: Server Setup is Key<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/sip-dial-in-for-video-conferencing#for-administrators-server-setup-is-key" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to For Administrators: Server Setup is Key" title="Direct link to For Administrators: Server Setup is Key" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>To enable SIP Dial-In, your system administrator must perform a one-time server-side configuration:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong><code>config.yaml</code> Setup:</strong> The <code>livekit_sip_info</code> section in your Plug-N-Meet server's <code>config.yaml</code> file must be configured with your SIP provider's details.</li>
<li class=""><strong>External SIP Provider:</strong> You will need an account with a SIP trunking provider (e.g., Twilio, SignalWire, etc.) to handle the actual phone calls to and from the public telephone network (PSTN).</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="security-considerations-encrypting-the-phone-leg">Security Considerations: Encrypting the Phone Leg<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/sip-dial-in-for-video-conferencing#security-considerations-encrypting-the-phone-leg" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Security Considerations: Encrypting the Phone Leg" title="Direct link to Security Considerations: Encrypting the Phone Leg" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>While the SIP audio stream itself cannot be end-to-end encrypted (as it must traverse the traditional phone network), the connection between your SIP gateway and your SIP provider <em>can</em> be secured. The <code>livekit/sip</code> service supports <code>SIPMediaEncryption</code> (SRTP), which encrypts the audio stream over the internet. It is the administrator's responsibility to enable this and ensure their chosen SIP provider supports it.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="e2ee-incompatibility">E2EE Incompatibility<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/sip-dial-in-for-video-conferencing#e2ee-incompatibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to E2EE Incompatibility" title="Direct link to E2EE Incompatibility" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>It's important to note that the SIP gateway must process unencrypted audio to bridge the call. Because of this, <strong>SIP Dial-In is automatically disabled for any room where End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) is active</strong>. This ensures that the integrity of your E2EE sessions is never compromised.</p>

<p>Plug-N-Meet's SIP Dial-In feature is more than just a convenience; it's a powerful tool for inclusivity and accessibility. It ensures that your meetings can reach a wider audience, providing a reliable audio connection even when internet access is a challenge.</p>
<p>By bridging the gap between online and traditional telephony, Plug-N-Meet empowers you to connect with everyone, everywhere.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="key-difference-1-the-architectural-philosophy">Key Difference 1: The Architectural Philosophy<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/bigbluebutton-vs-plugnmeet-alternative#key-difference-1-the-architectural-philosophy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Difference 1: The Architectural Philosophy" title="Direct link to Key Difference 1: The Architectural Philosophy" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The most fundamental difference is in the design philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>BigBlueButton</strong> is a <strong>monolith</strong>. Its core components are tightly interwoven. This means if your recording service is consuming all the CPU, it directly impacts the performance of your live meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Plug-N-Meet</strong> is built on a <strong>decoupled, microservices-based architecture</strong>. The application server, the LiveKit media server, and the recorder are all independent services. This allows you to isolate workloads and scale intelligently, leading to a significantly lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="key-difference-2-a-multi-layered-approach-to-customization">Key Difference 2: A Multi-Layered Approach to Customization<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/bigbluebutton-vs-plugnmeet-alternative#key-difference-2-a-multi-layered-approach-to-customization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Difference 2: A Multi-Layered Approach to Customization" title="Direct link to Key Difference 2: A Multi-Layered Approach to Customization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is a game-changer for anyone building a white-label or multi-tenant service.</p>
<p><strong>BigBlueButton</strong> uses a <strong>static theming</strong> approach. Customizing the look and feel is a complex, server-wide change that often requires modifying configuration files and restarting services.</p>
<p><strong>Plug-N-Meet</strong> is <strong>API-first and dynamic</strong>, offering a <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/true-white-label-video-conferencing">multi-layered approach to white-labeling</a></strong> that allows you to choose the level of customization that fits your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Level 1: Quick Rebranding:</strong> Instantly change logos, colors, and backgrounds via a simple <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/docs/developer-guide/design-customisation">configuration object</a></strong>.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Level 2: API-Driven Feature Control:</strong> Programmatically enable or disable features (like the whiteboard or breakout rooms) to create purpose-built experiences for different use cases.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Level 3: Deep Styling with Custom CSS:</strong> Provide a URL to your own stylesheet for pixel-perfect control over any UI element.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Level 4: True Native Integration:</strong> Use the <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/docs/api/get-client-files"><code>getClientFiles</code> API</a></strong> to render the client "headless" directly within your own application, giving you complete control over the layout and user experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>This layered flexibility makes it easy to get started but provides a path to a truly unique and deeply integrated product.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="key-difference-3-security-by-design---native-end-to-end-encryption">Key Difference 3: Security by Design - Native End-to-End Encryption<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/bigbluebutton-vs-plugnmeet-alternative#key-difference-3-security-by-design---native-end-to-end-encryption" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Difference 3: Security by Design - Native End-to-End Encryption" title="Direct link to Key Difference 3: Security by Design - Native End-to-End Encryption" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>BigBlueButton</strong>'s architecture requires the server to have access to unencrypted media streams for features like recording. This architectural choice is incompatible with a zero-trust E2EE model.</p>
<p><strong>Plug-N-Meet</strong> was built with a <strong>"privacy by design"</strong> philosophy. E2EE is a <strong>core, native feature</strong> of the platform. As detailed in our <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/docs/security-overview">Security Overview</a></strong>, we provide multiple API-controlled models, including a zero-trust option where the encryption key never touches the server, providing a mathematical guarantee of privacy.</p>

<p><strong>BigBlueButton</strong> records individual streams and attempts to reassemble them in post-processing, which can be a complex task.</p>
<p><strong>Plug-N-Meet</strong>, as detailed in our <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/recording-philosophy">Recording Philosophy</a></strong>, uses a headless browser to capture the final, rendered output. This produces a "what you see is what you get" MP4 file that is a perfect, high-fidelity replica of the live experience, ensuring all elements are perfectly synchronized.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="key-difference-5-long-term-maintainability-and-upgrades">Key Difference 5: Long-Term Maintainability and Upgrades<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/bigbluebutton-vs-plugnmeet-alternative#key-difference-5-long-term-maintainability-and-upgrades" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Difference 5: Long-Term Maintainability and Upgrades" title="Direct link to Key Difference 5: Long-Term Maintainability and Upgrades" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is a significant consideration for any administrator.</p>
<p><strong>BigBlueButton</strong> is <strong>tightly coupled to a specific OS version</strong>. The official upgrade path for a new OS often requires provisioning a brand new server and manually migrating all data and recordings. This can be a time-consuming and complex undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>Plug-N-Meet</strong> completely avoids this problem by using <strong>Docker</strong>. The entire application runs in isolated containers, abstracting it from the host OS. You can upgrade your server's OS without breaking the application, and updating Plug-N-Meet is as simple as pulling a new Docker image. This makes long-term maintenance dramatically simpler and safer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-migration-path-try-without-the-risk">The Migration Path: Try Without the Risk<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/bigbluebutton-vs-plugnmeet-alternative#the-migration-path-try-without-the-risk" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Migration Path: Try Without the Risk" title="Direct link to The Migration Path: Try Without the Risk" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>We understand that migrating from a deeply integrated platform is a big decision. That's why we made it painless.</p>
<p>Plug-N-Meet includes a <strong>BBB-compatible API layer</strong>. This means you can point your existing Greenlight, Moodle, or custom application to your Plug-N-Meet server, and it will work <strong>without any front-end code changes</strong>. This allows you to test the performance and stability of Plug-N-Meet in your own environment with zero risk.</p>

<p>BigBlueButton laid the foundation for open-source communication. It proved what was possible. As we detailed in our <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/why-we-built-plugnmeet">founder's story, "Why We Built Plug-N-Meet,"</a></strong> our platform is the next step in that evolution, built from the ground up to meet the modern web's demands for elastic scalability, developer agility, and long-term maintainability.</p>
<p>If you are feeling the pain points of a monolithic architecture and are looking for a more flexible, performant, and cost-effective solution, Plug-N-Meet is the modern alternative you've been waiting for.</p>

<p>Before processing any data, you <strong>must</strong> verify that the webhook request is genuinely from your Plug-N-Meet server. An unprotected endpoint can be exploited by anyone on the internet.</p>
<p>Plug-N-Meet uses a JWT-based signature in the <code>Authorization</code> header to secure webhooks. The process is:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">Verify the JWT token using your <code>API_SECRET</code>.</li>
<li class="">Calculate a SHA256 hash of the raw request body.</li>
<li class="">Compare your calculated hash with the <code>sha256</code> claim inside the verified token.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s how to implement this in a Node.js/Express middleware.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You sent a meeting link. Five minutes later, your most important client messages you: <em>"It's asking me to install something."</em> The momentum is lost.</p>
<p>This is a scenario every business, educator, and community manager dreads. In today's fast-paced world, friction is the enemy of engagement. The alternative? A world where users click a link and are instantly in the meeting, ready to collaborate.</p>
<p>This is the promise of a truly browser-based platform, and this guide shows you how to deliver that experience with Plug-N-Meet—without compromising on features.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-no-installation-philosophy">The "No Installation" Philosophy<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-build-frictionless-browser-based-video-platform#the-no-installation-philosophy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The &quot;No Installation&quot; Philosophy" title="Direct link to The &quot;No Installation&quot; Philosophy" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Before we dive into the "how," let's understand the "why." A browser-first approach is a strategic choice that prioritizes:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Works for anyone on any modern device (desktop or mobile) without barriers.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Security:</strong> Users aren't asked to trust and run unknown executables on their systems.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Speed:</strong> The time from click-to-conversation is measured in seconds, not minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how you can leverage Plug-N-Meet's browser-native architecture to build a complete video service that rivals desktop applications.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="step-1-deliver-instant-access-with-a-full-feature-set">Step 1: Deliver Instant Access with a Full Feature Set<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-build-frictionless-browser-based-video-platform#step-1-deliver-instant-access-with-a-full-feature-set" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Deliver Instant Access with a Full Feature Set" title="Direct link to Step 1: Deliver Instant Access with a Full Feature Set" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Your first step is to provide a core experience that feels complete. A browser doesn't mean "basic." With a simple <code>createRoom</code> API call, you can enable a rich, desktop-class feature set that runs entirely in the browser.</p>
<p><strong>What to Enable in Your API Call:</strong>
In your <code>createRoom</code> metadata, ensure these features are set to <code>true</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>HD Video &amp; Screensharing:</strong> Enable <code>allow_webcams</code> and <code>allow_screen_share</code>. Modern browsers handle this natively and securely.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Rich Collaboration Tools:</strong> Set <code>whiteboard_features.is_allow</code>, <code>shared_note_pad_features.is_allow</code>, and <code>chat_features.is_allow</code> to <code>true</code>. These tools are built-in and require no plugins.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Engagement &amp; Moderation:</strong> Enable <code>allow_raise_hand</code> and <code>polls_features.is_allow</code> to create an interactive environment identical to what users expect from desktop apps.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="step-2-add-intelligent-cloud-powered-features">Step 2: Add Intelligent, Cloud-Powered Features<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-build-frictionless-browser-based-video-platform#step-2-add-intelligent-cloud-powered-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Add Intelligent, Cloud-Powered Features" title="Direct link to Step 2: Add Intelligent, Cloud-Powered Features" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The most advanced features today aren't limited by a user's device; they are powered by the cloud. This is a natural fit for a browser-based platform.</p>
<p><strong>How to Configure It:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Add API Keys:</strong> In your <code>config.yaml</code>, add your API keys for Azure and Google, as shown in our <a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-add-ai-meeting-assistant-features">AI Features Guide</a>.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Enable in the Room:</strong> In your <code>createRoom</code> call, enable the <code>insights_features</code> block.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What You Deliver to the User (in the browser):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Live Captions &amp; Translation:</strong> A user can click the "T" icon to see live captions or translate the conversation into their native language.</li>
<li class=""><strong>AI Meeting Summaries:</strong> A moderator can start the <code>meeting_summarizing</code> service to generate AI meeting notes, which are then available via the API.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="step-3-leverage-unique-web-native-experiences">Step 3: Leverage Unique, Web-Native Experiences<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-build-frictionless-browser-based-video-platform#step-3-leverage-unique-web-native-experiences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 3: Leverage Unique, Web-Native Experiences" title="Direct link to Step 3: Leverage Unique, Web-Native Experiences" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Some features aren't just <em>possible</em> in a browser; they are <em>better</em>. The <strong>Embedded Web Content</strong> feature is a perfect example.</p>
<p><strong>How to Enable It:</strong>
In your <code>createRoom</code> API call, simply ensure <code>display_external_link_features.is_allow</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p><strong>What This Unlocks:</strong>
A moderator can now share any website directly within the meeting window. This is far more powerful than simple screen sharing. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Collaborate on a live Google Doc or Miro board.</li>
<li class="">Review a project dashboard from Jira or Trello together.</li>
<li class="">Walk a client through a live website or web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a uniquely powerful feature that a sandboxed desktop application often can't replicate.</p>

<p>A common concern with web apps is performance on poor networks. Plug-N-Meet solves this in the browser using modern WebRTC standards.</p>
<p><strong>How to Enable It:</strong>
This is on by default! <code>Simulcast</code> and <code>Dynacast</code> are core features of the underlying media server.</p>
<p><strong>What This Means for Your Users:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">The platform automatically adjusts video quality to match each user's bandwidth.</li>
<li class="">Video from off-screen participants is paused to save CPU and data.</li>
<li class="">The result is a stable, smooth experience that prevents lag and buffering, even on weak Wi-Fi or mobile connections—all without a single line of extra code from you.</li>
</ul>

<p>You don't need to force your users to download, install, and update software to provide a professional video conferencing experience. By embracing a browser-first architecture, you can deliver a service that is faster, more accessible, and packed with powerful, modern features.</p>
<p>With Plug-N-Meet, you can build a platform that "just works," letting your users focus on the conversation, not the installation bar.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In an age of heightened privacy concerns, offering End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) is one of the most powerful ways to build trust with your users. It provides a mathematical guarantee that conversations are confidential and that not even your server can access the media streams.</p>
<p>While the technology is complex, implementing it doesn't have to be. This guide will walk you through the two E2EE models available in Plug-N-Meet and show you how to enable them with a simple API call.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-enable-end-to-end-encryption#prerequisites" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prerequisites" title="Direct link to Prerequisites" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li class="">A running Plug-N-Meet server.</li>
<li class="">The ability to make API calls to your server.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="step-1-choose-your-security-model">Step 1: Choose Your Security Model<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-enable-end-to-end-encryption#step-1-choose-your-security-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Choose Your Security Model" title="Direct link to Step 1: Choose Your Security Model" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Before writing any code, you need to answer one question: <strong>Who should manage the encryption keys?</strong> Plug-N-Meet offers two distinct models, and your choice will determine the implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Model A: Server-Generated (Simple &amp; Secure):</strong> The Plug-N-Meet server generates, manages, and distributes a unique secret for each session. This is the easiest and most convenient method.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Model B: User-Provided (Zero-Knowledge):</strong> The users are responsible for creating and sharing a secret among themselves. Your server never sees the secret, providing the absolute highest level of privacy.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="step-2-implement-your-chosen-model">Step 2: Implement Your Chosen Model<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-enable-end-to-end-encryption#step-2-implement-your-chosen-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Implement Your Chosen Model" title="Direct link to Step 2: Implement Your Chosen Model" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Enabling E2EE is done within the <code>end_to_end_encryption_features</code> block of your <code>createRoom</code> API call.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-underlying-security-one-time-session-keys">The Underlying Security: One-Time Session Keys<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-enable-end-to-end-encryption#the-underlying-security-one-time-session-keys" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Underlying Security: One-Time Session Keys" title="Direct link to The Underlying Security: One-Time Session Keys" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Before we look at the two models, it's important to understand a key security feature that applies to <strong>both</strong>: every session gets its own unique encryption key.</p>
<p>No matter where the initial secret comes from (the server or the user), the client's browser never uses it directly. Instead, it combines the secret with the unique Session ID of the meeting to generate a final, one-time encryption key.</p>
<p>This process ensures that even if you reuse the same room ID for multiple meetings, every single session is cryptographically isolated, preventing any link between them.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="option-a-the-simple--secure-way-server-generated-keys">Option A: The Simple &amp; Secure Way (Server-Generated Keys)<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/how-to-enable-end-to-end-encryption#option-a-the-simple--secure-way-server-generated-keys" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Option A: The Simple &amp; Secure Way (Server-Generated Keys)" title="Direct link to Option A: The Simple &amp; Secure Way (Server-Generated Keys)" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>This is the recommended path for most applications. You get strong E2EE without needing to build any custom key-sharing logic.</p>
<p>In your <code>createRoom</code> metadata, set <code>is_enabled</code> to <code>true</code> and <code>enabled_self_insert_encryption_key</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> When a user joins, the server provides a unique secret for the session. The client then uses the one-time key generation process described above to secure the meeting.</p>

<p><strong>The User Experience:</strong>
When a user joins this room, the Plug-N-Meet client will automatically prompt them to enter the shared secret key.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>If they enter the correct key</strong>, their client will use it to generate the final session key (as described above) and they will be able to see, hear, and interact with other participants seamlessly.</li>
<li class=""><strong>If they enter an incorrect key (or no key)</strong>, they will still join the session, but they will not be able to see or hear anyone, nor will their own media be visible to others. They will see decryption error messages, indicating that they do not have the correct key to participate.</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior is by design, as the server has zero knowledge of the key and therefore cannot validate it upon entry. You must provide your users with an "out-of-band" way to share this key (e.g., a secure chat app, a password manager, or verbally).</p>

<p>How do you know E2EE is active? The most obvious sign is that certain server-side features will be <strong>automatically disabled</strong>.</p>
<p>If you try to use the following features in an E2EE-enabled room, they will fail, which is the expected behavior and proof that your server cannot access the media:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Cloud Recording:</strong> The server can't record what it can't see.</li>
<li class=""><strong>RTMP Broadcasting:</strong> Similarly, the server cannot broadcast an encrypted stream.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Audio-Based AI Features:</strong> The AI Meeting Assistant cannot transcribe or summarize audio it cannot decrypt.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a core part of the security design, ensuring that your choice of privacy is enforced across the entire platform.</p>

<p>Implementing End-to-End Encryption is a powerful step, but it's just one part of a broader "<strong>privacy by design</strong>" philosophy. Plug-N-Meet was architected to be a secure data relay, not a data store.</p>
<p>Whether it's using the LiveKit SFU to route encrypted media packets or NATS to broadcast messages, the server's primary job is to pass data between participants. It has no interest in what that data is, and in the case of E2EE, it has no ability to inspect it. This philosophy extends to features like our use of <a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/client-side-storage-privacy-resilience">client-side storage</a>, where session data lives in your browser, not on our servers.</p>
<p>By choosing Plug-N-Meet, you're not just getting a feature; you're adopting a platform built on the principle that the most secure user data is the data you never have to touch.</p>

<p>The first step is to tell your Plug-N-Meet server how to connect to the AI services. Open your <code>config.yaml</code> file on your server and find the <code>insights</code> section.</p>
<p>The new configuration is highly flexible. First, you define your <code>providers</code> (your accounts), and then you assign those providers to specific <code>services</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a minimal configuration to enable all three features:</p>

<p>That's it! Any room created with this metadata will now have the AI Meeting Assistant enabled.</p>

<p>When a user joins a room created with these settings, the AI features are available to be activated.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Live Captions &amp; Translation:</strong> A moderator must first enable the service from the <strong>3-dots menu &gt; Transcription and Translation</strong>. Once enabled, participants will see a new <strong>"T" icon</strong> in their main control bar. Clicking this opens a menu where they can view the live captions and select their own preferred language for translation.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Interactive AI Chat Assistant:</strong> Any user can interact with the AI assistant. In the side panel, a new <strong>"AI Assistant"</strong> tab will appear. Clicking this opens a dedicated chat interface where a user can privately ask the AI questions about the meeting content, get clarifications, or ask for help without cluttering the main participant chat.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Automated Meeting Notes:</strong> To generate <strong>AI meeting notes</strong>, a moderator must start the service from the <strong>3-dots menu &gt; AI Tools &gt; Meeting Summarization</strong>. The <strong>meeting assistant AI</strong> will then process the audio in the background.</p>

<p>In just a few minutes, you've transformed a standard video call into an intelligent, interactive, and globally inclusive meeting experience. By leveraging Plug-N-Meet's provider-agnostic AI layer, you can easily add a powerful <strong>meeting assistant AI</strong> that gives you a significant edge, all while maintaining full control over your self-hosted platform.</p>
<p>The real power of this platform is that your data isn't trapped. After the meeting ends, you can use the <strong><a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/docs/api/artifact/fetch">Artifacts API</a></strong> to programmatically retrieve the summary and transcription, allowing you to build powerful integrations with your new <strong>AI meeting notes</strong>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wanted to share a high-quality video during a meeting, but the file was too large to upload? Or maybe you have a copyrighted video that you are allowed to show, but you can't share the file itself. Perhaps you're a power user who wants to create a professional presentation with multiple cameras, overlays, and smooth transitions using a tool like OBS Studio.</p>
<p>Traditionally, getting this kind of professional content into a live meeting has been complex or impossible.</p>
<p>At plugNmeet, we believe you should be able to use the best tools for the job. That's why we've built a simple but powerful feature called <strong>Live Stream Input</strong>. Think of it as giving your meeting its own private, secure TV channel. You can broadcast directly into your meeting room from professional software like OBS, and your stream appears as a regular participant.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="why-stream-directly-into-your-meeting">Why Stream Directly into Your Meeting?<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/obs-rtmp-whip-ingress#why-stream-directly-into-your-meeting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Stream Directly into Your Meeting?" title="Direct link to Why Stream Directly into Your Meeting?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>This feature unlocks a world of new possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Share Large or Private Videos:</strong> Play a high-resolution video file from your local computer without ever having to upload it.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Professional Live Productions:</strong> Use OBS Studio to switch between multiple cameras, share specific application windows, add professional graphics and lower thirds, and create a polished, TV-style presentation.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Enhanced Demonstrations:</strong> Show a complex software workflow or a live coding session with all the power and customization of your desktop setup.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="how-to-set-it-up-a-simple-step-by-step-guide">How to Set It Up: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/obs-rtmp-whip-ingress#how-to-set-it-up-a-simple-step-by-step-guide" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Set It Up: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide" title="Direct link to How to Set It Up: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Getting started is incredibly easy. Here’s how you do it from within your plugNmeet room:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Open the Settings Menu:</strong> Click the three-dots menu in the top-right corner of your meeting room and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Find Live Stream Input:</strong> In the settings panel, navigate to the <strong>Live Stream Input</strong> tab.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Choose Your "Channel" Type (RTMP or WHIP):</strong>
You'll see an option called "Input Type." This lets you choose the technology for your stream. Think of it like choosing between two types of cables to connect your camera:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>RTMP:</strong> This is the trusty, universal standard. It's been used for years by platforms like YouTube and Twitch and is supported by almost every streaming application. It's a great, reliable choice.</li>
<li class=""><strong>WHIP:</strong> This is the new, modern standard designed specifically for real-time communication. It's generally faster, with less delay between your stream and what your audience sees. If your software supports it, WHIP is the future-proof option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Give Your Stream a Name:</strong> In the <strong>Display Name</strong> field, you can type in a name for your stream. This is the name that will appear in the participant list. For example, "Main Presentation" or "Guest Speaker Cam." If you leave it blank, it will default to "Broadcaster."</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Generate Your Private Link:</strong> Click the <strong>"Generate link"</strong> button. plugNmeet will instantly create a unique and secure address for your private stream. You'll see two fields: a <strong>URL</strong> and a <strong>Secret</strong> (or "Stream Key").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="connecting-your-streaming-software-like-obs">Connecting Your Streaming Software (like OBS)<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/obs-rtmp-whip-ingress#connecting-your-streaming-software-like-obs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Connecting Your Streaming Software (like OBS)" title="Direct link to Connecting Your Streaming Software (like OBS)" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Now, you just need to tell your software (we'll use OBS as an example) where to send the stream.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>For RTMP (The Universal Standard):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="">In OBS settings, go to "Stream."</li>
<li class="">For "Service," choose "Custom..."</li>
<li class="">Copy the <strong>URL</strong> from plugNmeet and paste it into the "Server" field in OBS.</li>
<li class="">Copy the <strong>Secret</strong> from plugNmeet and paste it into the "Stream Key" field in OBS.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>For WHIP (The Modern Choice):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="">In OBS settings, go to "Stream."</li>
<li class="">For "Service," choose "WHIP."</li>
<li class="">Combine the URL and Secret from plugNmeet into a single line. For example: <code>https://your-plugnmeet-domain.com/whip/A_LONG_SECRET_KEY_HERE</code></li>
<li class="">Paste this full, combined address into the "Server" field in OBS.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Leave the "Bearer Token" field in OBS blank.</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you hit "Start Streaming" in OBS, your stream will magically appear as a new participant in your plugNmeet room for everyone to see!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've all been in that frustrating video call. Someone is speaking, and suddenly their video freezes. Their voice becomes robotic and distorted. You miss a crucial piece of the conversation, and the flow of the meeting is completely broken.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've all been in that frustrating video call. Someone is speaking, and suddenly their video freezes. Their voice becomes robotic and distorted. You miss a crucial piece of the conversation, and the flow of the meeting is completely broken.</p>
<p>Often, we blame our internet connection. But what if the problem isn't just the connection, but the software's inability to adapt to it?</p>
<p>At plugNmeet, we believe that a video conferencing platform should work intelligently to provide the best possible experience, no matter what your internet situation is. That's why we've built a "smart streaming" philosophy into our core, using advanced techniques to ensure your calls are smooth, stable, and use as little data as possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-problem-the-one-size-fits-all-video-stream">The Problem: The "One-Size-Fits-All" Video Stream<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-video-streaming#the-problem-the-one-size-fits-all-video-stream" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Problem: The &quot;One-Size-Fits-All&quot; Video Stream" title="Direct link to The Problem: The &quot;One-Size-Fits-All&quot; Video Stream" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Most video applications work like a firehose. They try to send a single, high-quality stream of video data to everyone, all the time. If your internet connection is a wide-open pipe, this works great.</p>
<p>But what if your connection is more like a narrow straw? Trying to force a firehose of data through a tiny straw leads to a predictable result: a clog. In video terms, this "clog" is what you experience as lag, frozen video, and dropped calls.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-plugnmeet-solution-smart-adaptive-streaming">The plugNmeet Solution: Smart, Adaptive Streaming<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-video-streaming#the-plugnmeet-solution-smart-adaptive-streaming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The plugNmeet Solution: Smart, Adaptive Streaming" title="Direct link to The plugNmeet Solution: Smart, Adaptive Streaming" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Instead of a single firehose, we use several smart techniques to adapt the video stream to the reality of each person's connection and what they are actually seeing on their screen.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="technique-1-offering-multiple-qualities-like-netflix-does">Technique 1: Offering Multiple Qualities (Like Netflix Does)<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-video-streaming#technique-1-offering-multiple-qualities-like-netflix-does" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technique 1: Offering Multiple Qualities (Like Netflix Does)" title="Direct link to Technique 1: Offering Multiple Qualities (Like Netflix Does)" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Think about watching a movie on Netflix. If your internet slows down, the picture might get a little less sharp for a moment, but the movie keeps playing. Netflix does this by having multiple quality versions of the movie available.</p>
<p>We do the same thing for live video. This is called <strong>Simulcast</strong>.</p>
<p>For every person speaking, our server intelligently prepares multiple versions of their video stream: a high-quality one, a medium one, and a low-quality one. Your device automatically "tunes in" to the best quality it can handle at any given moment without freezing. The result is a continuous, uninterrupted conversation, even if the video quality has to adjust temporarily.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="technique-2-pausing-what-you-cant-see">Technique 2: Pausing What You Can't See<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-video-streaming#technique-2-pausing-what-you-cant-see" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technique 2: Pausing What You Can't See" title="Direct link to Technique 2: Pausing What You Can't See" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Imagine a meeting with 20 people. On your screen, you can probably only see 9 of them at once. So why should your computer waste precious data downloading the video streams of the 11 people who are off-screen?</p>
<p>It shouldn't. This is called <strong>Dynacast</strong>.</p>
<p>plugNmeet is smart enough to automatically pause the video streams of participants who are not currently visible on your screen. The moment you scroll or switch pages to bring them into view, their video instantly resumes. This single technique can dramatically reduce the amount of data your computer needs to download, making the call more stable for you and everyone else.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="technique-3-sending-the-just-right-size">Technique 3: Sending the "Just Right" Size<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-video-streaming#technique-3-sending-the-just-right-size" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technique 3: Sending the &quot;Just Right&quot; Size" title="Direct link to Technique 3: Sending the &quot;Just Right&quot; Size" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>On your screen, the person speaking might be in a large main window, while other participants are in tiny thumbnail squares. It makes no sense to download a full, high-definition video stream just to display it in a tiny box.</p>
<p>Our platform is smart about this, too. It automatically sends a much smaller, lower-resolution video for thumbnails, while reserving the high-quality video for the main speaker. This further reduces data usage and frees up your connection to focus on what's most important.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="technique-4-prioritizing-voice-above-all-else">Technique 4: Prioritizing Voice Above All Else<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-video-streaming#technique-4-prioritizing-voice-above-all-else" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technique 4: Prioritizing Voice Above All Else" title="Direct link to Technique 4: Prioritizing Voice Above All Else" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>What is the most important part of any conversation? <strong>Hearing what the other person is saying.</strong></p>
<p>Our platform understands this fundamental rule. When a user's internet connection becomes very unstable, the system performs a kind of digital triage. It knows that it is always better to have a clear conversation with a frozen video than to have a choppy, robotic voice with a moving picture.</p>
<p>So, it makes a smart choice: it will <strong>temporarily pause the video stream</strong> to dedicate all available, limited bandwidth to keeping the audio channel clear and uninterrupted. The moment the connection stabilizes, the video seamlessly resumes. This ensures that your conversation can always continue, even in the most challenging network conditions.</p>

<li class=""><strong>More Resilient:</strong> It gracefully handles fluctuations in network quality, preventing the freezes and robotic voices that kill conversations.</li>
<li class=""><strong>More Cost-Effective:</strong> By intelligently reducing data usage, it's a lifesaver for anyone on a metered or expensive data plan.</li>
<li class=""><strong>More Accessible:</strong> It ensures that users in areas with variable connectivity can still have a meaningful and productive meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to make real-time communication a stable, reliable utility for everyone, everywhere. Our smart streaming philosophy is how we deliver on that promise.</p>

        <updated>2025-12-20T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an era where data breaches are daily news and "free" services monetize your conversations, privacy can no longer be an afterthought. It must be the foundation.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In an era where data breaches are daily news and "free" services monetize your conversations, privacy can no longer be an afterthought. It must be the foundation.</p>
<p>When we built Plug-N-Meet, we didn't just want to create another video conferencing tool. We wanted to build a platform that respects the user's right to privacy by default. This meant making hard architectural choices—prioritizing security over easy data harvesting, and giving control back to the user rather than hoarding it on the server.</p>
<p>If you are building a telehealth platform, a legal consultation app, or simply a secure meeting space for your team, you need more than just a "secure" sticker. You need an architecture designed for the Zero-Trust era.</p>
<p>Here is how Plug-N-Meet delivers on that promise.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="1-the-gold-standard-true-zero-trust-e2ee">1. The Gold Standard: True Zero-Trust E2EE<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/privacy-by-design-zero-trust#1-the-gold-standard-true-zero-trust-e2ee" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. The Gold Standard: True Zero-Trust E2EE" title="Direct link to 1. The Gold Standard: True Zero-Trust E2EE" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Most video platforms claim to be "secure" because they use encryption in transit (TLS/DTLS). While this protects your data from hackers on the coffee shop Wi-Fi, it has a major flaw: the server itself still decrypts your video to process it. This means the service provider (and anyone who hacks them) can see and hear everything.</p>
<p>Plug-N-Meet offers a <strong>Zero-Trust</strong> alternative: <strong>User-Provided Key End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)</strong>.</p>
<p>When you enable this mode (<code>enabled_self_insert_encryption_key: true</code>), the encryption keys are generated by the participants and shared directly between them (e.g., via a password manager or secure chat). <strong>These keys never leave the user's device.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Result:</strong> The server only relays encrypted packets. It mathematically cannot decrypt the video or audio.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Benefit:</strong> You achieve true "Zero Knowledge" privacy. Even if the server is compromised, your meetings remain a black box.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="2-data-minimization--ephemeral-storage">2. Data Minimization &amp; Ephemeral Storage<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/privacy-by-design-zero-trust#2-data-minimization--ephemeral-storage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Data Minimization &amp; Ephemeral Storage" title="Direct link to 2. Data Minimization &amp; Ephemeral Storage" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>A core principle of modern privacy (and regulations like GDPR) is <strong>Data Minimization</strong>: don't collect what you don't need, and don't keep it longer than necessary.</p>
<p>Plug-N-Meet is designed with <strong>ephemeral storage</strong> at its core:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Volatile Session State:</strong> Active meeting data (who is in the room, who is muted) lives in high-performance, in-memory stores like Redis or NATS KV. When the meeting ends, this data is naturally cleared.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Client-Side History:</strong> Chat history and user preferences are stored in the user's own browser using <code>IndexedDB</code>, not permanently on our servers. This puts the user in control of their own data footprint.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Granular Analytics:</strong> You have the power to disable analytics entirely (<code>enable_analytics: false</code>) or configure the system to store only metadata (e.g., "User A spoke for 5 minutes") without ever recording the content of what was said.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="3-the-nats-advantage-protocol-level-access-control">3. The NATS Advantage: Protocol-Level Access Control<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/privacy-by-design-zero-trust#3-the-nats-advantage-protocol-level-access-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. The NATS Advantage: Protocol-Level Access Control" title="Direct link to 3. The NATS Advantage: Protocol-Level Access Control" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Many web applications rely solely on application-level logic (e.g., <code>if (user.isAdmin)</code>) to check if a user should see a message. If that logic has a bug, data leaks.</p>
<p>Plug-N-Meet takes a more robust approach by leveraging the powerful security features of <strong>NATS JetStream</strong> to enforce the <strong>Principle of Least Privilege</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Dynamic Permissions:</strong> When a user joins, the system generates a custom set of NATS permissions specific to that user's session.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Protocol Enforcement:</strong> These permissions are enforced by the NATS server itself, not just the Plug-N-Meet application code.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Result:</strong> A participant literally <strong>cannot</strong> subscribe to a data stream they aren't authorized for. Even if a modified client tries to "listen in" on another room or a private chat, the NATS server will reject the subscription request at the protocol level.</li>
</ul>
<p>This provides a hard security boundary that is rare in self-hosted web conferencing tools, ensuring that data isolation is enforced by the infrastructure, not just the code.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="4-defense-in-depth-security">4. Defense-in-Depth Security<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/privacy-by-design-zero-trust#4-defense-in-depth-security" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Defense-in-Depth Security" title="Direct link to 4. Defense-in-Depth Security" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Privacy relies on security, and security requires layers. Beyond NATS and E2EE, we employ multiple other safeguards:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Token-Based Access:</strong> Every user joins with a short-lived, one-time-use token. This prevents "replay attacks" where a hacker tries to reuse an old link to crash a meeting.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Salted Key Derivation:</strong> As detailed in our <a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/docs/security-overview">Security Overview</a>, we use the unique <code>session_id</code> as a salt when deriving encryption keys. This ensures that even if a room ID is reused, every single session has a unique, cryptographically isolated key.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="5-privacy-aware-ai">5. Privacy-Aware AI<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/privacy-by-design-zero-trust#5-privacy-aware-ai" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Privacy-Aware AI" title="Direct link to 5. Privacy-Aware AI" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Integrating AI into meetings is powerful, but it's often a privacy nightmare. We've solved this with a "Privacy First" integration strategy.</p>
<p>The system is designed to be <strong>context-aware</strong>. If you enable End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) with a user-provided key, Plug-N-Meet <strong>automatically disables</strong> all audio-based AI features (like transcription and recording).</p>
<p>Why? Because the AI bot on the server cannot decrypt the audio stream. This prevents the dangerous scenario where a user <em>thinks</em> they are in a secure, private meeting, but an AI service is silently listening in the background. With Plug-N-Meet, if you choose maximum privacy, the system enforces it across the board.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="6-the-ultimate-privacy-feature-self-hosting">6. The Ultimate Privacy Feature: Self-Hosting<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/privacy-by-design-zero-trust#6-the-ultimate-privacy-feature-self-hosting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 6. The Ultimate Privacy Feature: Self-Hosting" title="Direct link to 6. The Ultimate Privacy Feature: Self-Hosting" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Finally, the most important privacy feature of Plug-N-Meet is that <strong>you own it</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>No Black Boxes:</strong> Because the code is open source, it can be audited. There are no hidden "telemetry" trackers sending your data back to a headquarters.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Your Infrastructure, Your Rules:</strong> You aren't renting privacy from a third-party SaaS provider. You host the server, you control the database, and you own the logs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/privacy-by-design-zero-trust#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In a world of surveillance capitalism, privacy is a competitive advantage. Whether you are building for healthcare (HIPAA), education (FERPA), or enterprise security, Plug-N-Meet provides a foundation that doesn't just "support" privacy—it enforces it.</p>
<p>By combining Zero-Trust E2EE, protocol-level access control, and the transparency of open source, we've built a platform where you don't have to trust us. You just have to trust the code.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When building any critical application, "scalability" and "high availability" (HA) are often top of mind. But for many, these terms conjure images of complex, multi-node clusters, expensive infrastructure, and a steep learning curve. The truth is, for most plugNmeet users, achieving both performance and resilience can be much simpler and more cost-effective than you might think.</p>
<p>This article will demystify the relationship between scalability and HA, and guide you through a pragmatic, phased approach to optimizing your plugNmeet deployment. We'll show you how to leverage the power of your cloud provider for HA, and why separating your recording server is almost always your first and best step towards true scalability.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="scalability-vs-high-availability-understanding-the-difference">Scalability vs. High Availability: Understanding the Difference<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-scaling-ha-recorder#scalability-vs-high-availability-understanding-the-difference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scalability vs. High Availability: Understanding the Difference" title="Direct link to Scalability vs. High Availability: Understanding the Difference" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>While often used interchangeably, scalability and high availability address distinct challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Scalability:</strong> The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources. For plugNmeet, this means handling more concurrent users, more rooms, or more recordings.</li>
<li class=""><strong>High Availability (HA):</strong> The ability of a system to remain operational and accessible even if some components fail. This is about minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous service.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="leveraging-cloud-provider-ha-dont-re-invent-the-wheel">Leveraging Cloud Provider HA: Don't Re-Invent the Wheel<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-scaling-ha-recorder#leveraging-cloud-provider-ha-dont-re-invent-the-wheel" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Leveraging Cloud Provider HA: Don't Re-Invent the Wheel" title="Direct link to Leveraging Cloud Provider HA: Don't Re-Invent the Wheel" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Many users deploy plugNmeet on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or DigitalOcean. These providers offer robust, built-in High Availability features for their virtual machines and underlying infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Automatic Restarts:</strong> If a virtual machine fails, the cloud provider will often automatically restart it on healthy hardware.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Managed Databases:</strong> Services like managed MySQL/MariaDB or Redis often come with built-in replication and failover, ensuring your data layer is resilient.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Redundant Networking:</strong> Cloud networks are designed with redundancy to minimize single points of failure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> For many plugNmeet users, the "HA" of their <em>server instance</em> is already handled by their cloud provider. You might not need to build complex application-level HA for your <code>plugnmeet-server</code> if your underlying VM is already highly available. Focus your efforts where they matter most.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="plugnmeets-pragmatic-scaling-strategy">plugNmeet's Pragmatic Scaling Strategy<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-scaling-ha-recorder#plugnmeets-pragmatic-scaling-strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to plugNmeet's Pragmatic Scaling Strategy" title="Direct link to plugNmeet's Pragmatic Scaling Strategy" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Instead of immediately jumping to a complex, multi-node HA setup for plugNmeet itself, we recommend a phased approach that prioritizes impact and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="phase-1-separate-the-recorder-the-1-priority-for-scalability">Phase 1: Separate the Recorder (The #1 Priority for Scalability)<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-scaling-ha-recorder#phase-1-separate-the-recorder-the-1-priority-for-scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 1: Separate the Recorder (The #1 Priority for Scalability)" title="Direct link to Phase 1: Separate the Recorder (The #1 Priority for Scalability)" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is the most impactful and cost-effective step for improving your plugNmeet deployment's scalability and performance.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Problem:</strong> Recording is a CPU-intensive task. Running the recorder on the same server as your live media server (<code>plugnmeet-server</code> + LiveKit) can starve the media server of resources, leading to poor quality for live participants.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Solution:</strong> Deploy the <code>plugnmeet-recorder</code> on a <strong>separate, dedicated server</strong>.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> This recorder server doesn't need to be expensive or highly available. It can be a smaller, cheaper VM. From our testing, a 2-vCPU server can handle approximately 2-3 simultaneous recordings, depending on the number of webcams active in the session. If the recorder server goes down, recordings might be temporarily delayed, but your live meetings remain unaffected. NATS JetStream's queue worker pattern ensures that recording jobs will simply wait for an available recorder to pick them up.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="phase-2-vertical-scaling-more-power-for-your-main-server">Phase 2: Vertical Scaling (More Power for Your Main Server)<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-scaling-ha-recorder#phase-2-vertical-scaling-more-power-for-your-main-server" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 2: Vertical Scaling (More Power for Your Main Server)" title="Direct link to Phase 2: Vertical Scaling (More Power for Your Main Server)" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Once your recorder is isolated, the next step is often to simply give your main <code>plugnmeet-server</code> more power. A single plugNmeet setup can handle hundreds of concurrent users on a good server, so it's wise to start with a reasonable configuration and scale up as needed.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Strategy:</strong> Start with a solid baseline and upgrade your main server's resources based on observed load. Prioritize increasing CPU/RAM and network bandwidth. For example, if you start with a 1 Gbps uplink and notice bottlenecks, upgrading to a 2 Gbps or 5 Gbps connection is a simple and highly effective scaling tactic.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Benefit:</strong> plugNmeet and LiveKit, being written in Go, are incredibly efficient. A single, well-provisioned server can handle hundreds of concurrent users. This is far simpler and cheaper than managing a multi-node cluster.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="phase-3-horizontal-scaling-when-you-really-need-it">Phase 3: Horizontal Scaling (When You <em>Really</em> Need It)<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/smart-scaling-ha-recorder#phase-3-horizontal-scaling-when-you-really-need-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to phase-3-horizontal-scaling-when-you-really-need-it" title="Direct link to phase-3-horizontal-scaling-when-you-really-need-it" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Only after you've isolated the recorder and vertically scaled your main server to its practical limits should you consider a multi-node, horizontally scaled plugNmeet deployment. This is for extreme scale or custom HA requirements beyond what your cloud provider offers.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Strategy:</strong> Deploy multiple <code>plugnmeet-server</code> instances behind a load balancer, and potentially cluster LiveKit and NATS.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Benefit:</strong> This provides maximum resilience and capacity for thousands of concurrent users.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Caveat:</strong> This is significantly more complex and should only be pursued when your usage patterns clearly demand it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Achieving a high-performing and resilient plugNmeet deployment doesn't always mean building the most complex architecture from day one. By making smart, phased decisions, you can optimize for both cost and performance:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Leverage your cloud provider's built-in HA</strong> for your server instances.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Prioritize separating your recording server</strong> on a cheaper, dedicated VM to immediately boost live meeting quality.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Vertically scale your main server</strong> before considering horizontal scaling.</li>
</ol>
<p>This pragmatic approach ensures you get the most out of plugNmeet without unnecessary complexity or expense, allowing you to grow intelligently.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A great API-first platform doesn't just allow you to <em>initiate</em> actions; it tells you when actions <em>happen</em>. This is the power of webhooks. They are the key to transforming a simple video conferencing tool into a deeply integrated and automated part of your business ecosystem.</p>
<p>plugNmeet provides a rich set of webhook events that fire in real-time as things happen inside a meeting. By listening for these events, you can build powerful, automated workflows that save time, reduce manual work, and create a smarter application.</p>
<p>This article will explore five practical examples of workflows you can build today with plugNmeet webhooks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="what-are-webhooks">What Are Webhooks?<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/powerful-workflows-with-webhooks#what-are-webhooks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Are Webhooks?" title="Direct link to What Are Webhooks?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In simple terms, a webhook is a notification. You provide plugNmeet with a URL, and when a specific event occurs (like a user joining a room or a recording finishing processing), our server sends a POST request with a JSON payload of data to your URL. Your application can then use this data to trigger any action you can imagine.</p>
<p>Let's dive into the examples.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="1-the-smart-sales-demo-crm-integration">1. The Smart Sales Demo: CRM Integration<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/powerful-workflows-with-webhooks#1-the-smart-sales-demo-crm-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. The Smart Sales Demo: CRM Integration" title="Direct link to 1. The Smart Sales Demo: CRM Integration" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Automatically log every sales demo in your CRM and notify the sales team when a high-value lead joins the call.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Trigger:</strong> <code>participant_joined</code> event.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Workflow:</strong>
<ol>
<li class="">When a participant joins a room, your webhook endpoint receives their <code>participant.user_id</code> and <code>participant.name</code>.</li>
<li class="">Your server looks up this user in your CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot).</li>
<li class="">If the user is a known lead, you update their CRM record with a new activity: "Attended sales demo in room <code>[room.room_id]</code>."</li>
<li class="">If the lead has a high deal value, you can even send a real-time Slack notification to the account owner: "🔥 High-value lead 'John Doe' just joined the demo!"</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="2-the-automated-classroom-attendance-tracking">2. The Automated Classroom: Attendance Tracking<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/powerful-workflows-with-webhooks#2-the-automated-classroom-attendance-tracking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. The Automated Classroom: Attendance Tracking" title="Direct link to 2. The Automated Classroom: Attendance Tracking" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Automatically take attendance for an online class and mark students as present or absent in your Learning Management System (LMS).</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Triggers:</strong> <code>participant_joined</code> and <code>participant_left</code> events.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Workflow:</strong>
<ol>
<li class="">Your webhook endpoint listens for join and leave events for a specific classroom session.</li>
<li class="">It logs the <code>participant.user_id</code> and timestamps for each event.</li>
<li class="">At the end of the session (triggered by the <code>room_finished</code> event), your server processes the logs. It calculates the total duration each student was present.</li>
<li class="">It then makes an API call to your LMS to automatically mark students as "Present," "Absent," or "Tardy" based on your defined business logic (e.g., present if they attended &gt;80% of the session).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="3-the-content-pipeline-automatic-recording-archival">3.

The Content Pipeline: Automatic Recording Archival" title="Direct link to 3. The Content Pipeline: Automatic Recording Archival" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Create a seamless pipeline that takes a finished recording, transcribes it, and uploads it to a secure, long-term storage location.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Trigger:</strong> <code>end_recording</code> event.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Workflow:</strong>
<ol>
<li class="">When a recording has finished processing, your webhook endpoint receives a payload containing the <code>recording_info.record_id</code> and a link to the final MP4 file.</li>
<li class="">Your server can then download this file.</li>
<li class="">(Optional) You can send the audio track to a transcription service (like AWS Transcribe or Deepgram) to generate a text transcript.</li>
<li class="">Finally, your server uploads both the MP4 video and the text transcript to a secure, long-term storage solution like Amazon S3 or a private file server, and deletes the original from the plugNmeet server to save space.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="4-the-collaborative-review-screen-share-notifications">4.

The Collaborative Review: Screen Share Notifications" title="Direct link to 4. The Collaborative Review: Screen Share Notifications" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> In a collaborative design review or code review session, automatically notify a project management tool or a Slack channel when a participant starts sharing their screen, creating a timeline of key presentation moments.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Trigger:</strong> <code>track_published</code> event.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Workflow:</strong>
<ol>
<li class="">Your webhook endpoint listens for the <code>track_published</code> event.</li>
<li class="">You check the <code>track.source</code> in the event payload. If the <code>track.source</code> is <code>SCREEN_SHARE</code>, you know a user has just started a screen share.</li>
<li class="">Your server can then make an API call to your project management tool (like Jira or Asana) to add a comment to a specific task: "User '[participant.name]' started a screen share at <code>[createdAt]</code>."</li>
<li class="">Alternatively, you could post a message to a dedicated Slack channel: "📺 '[participant.name]' is now presenting their screen in the design review meeting." This creates a real-time log of when different team members presented.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

The Billing Engine: Pay-per-Minute Access" title="Direct link to 5. The Billing Engine: Pay-per-Minute Access" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Build a service where users pay for the time they spend in a consultation or premium event.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>The Triggers:</strong> <code>participant_joined</code> and <code>participant_left</code> events.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The Workflow:</strong>
<ol>
<li class="">When a participant joins a premium room, your webhook logs the <code>participant.user_id</code> and the <code>createdAt</code> timestamp.</li>
<li class="">When they leave, the <code>participant_left</code> event provides the <code>createdAt</code> timestamp for their departure.</li>
<li class="">Your server calculates the total duration in minutes.</li>
<li class="">This duration is then used to make an API call to your billing system (like Stripe or Paddle) to either decrement a user's pre-purchased credits or charge their account for the time used.</li>
</ol>
</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How much does your video conferencing solution <em>really</em> cost? The answer is often more complex than just the number on your monthly bill.</p>
<p>For businesses evaluating a video platform, the choice between a public SaaS provider (like Zoom or Google Meet) and a self-hosted solution (like plugNmeet) often comes down to a calculation of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). While SaaS pricing seems simple at first, it hides long-term costs that can stifle growth. Conversely, self-hosting has a different cost structure—one that offers predictability, control, and significant savings at scale.</p>
<p>This article will break down the true TCO of both models to help you make a smarter, more strategic decision.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-saas-model-a-story-of-escalating-rent">The SaaS Model: A Story of Escalating Rent<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas#the-saas-model-a-story-of-escalating-rent" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The SaaS Model: A Story of Escalating Rent" title="Direct link to The SaaS Model: A Story of Escalating Rent" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The pricing model for most SaaS video platforms is designed for simplicity and immediate adoption. It's typically a per-user, per-month fee. This is the "rent" you pay for using their service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-visible-costs">The Visible Costs:<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas#the-visible-costs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Visible Costs:" title="Direct link to The Visible Costs:" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>License Fees:</strong> The obvious cost. For example, $15 per host per month. For a company with 100 hosts, this is a predictable $1,500 every month.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-hidden-costs-where-tco-spikes">The Hidden Costs (Where TCO Spikes):<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas#the-hidden-costs-where-tco-spikes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Hidden Costs (Where TCO Spikes):" title="Direct link to The Hidden Costs (Where TCO Spikes):" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><strong>The Penalty for Growth:</strong> The per-user model means your costs scale directly with your success. As you hire more employees or serve more customers, your bill goes up in a linear, often painful, way. You are penalized for growing your business.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Overage Charges:</strong> Many plans have limits on meeting duration or number of participants. Exceeding these can result in expensive overage fees.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>API &amp; Integration Fees:</strong> Need to integrate the video service with your CRM or scheduling tool? Many providers charge extra for API access, sometimes at a steep per-minute or per-call rate.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Lack of Brand Equity:</strong> This is a strategic cost. Every time a customer joins a meeting, they see the SaaS provider's brand, not yours. You are paying to build <em>their</em> brand recognition, not your own.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The SaaS TCO is a recurring operational expense (OpEx) that is unpredictable and scales with your user count.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-self-hosted-model-the-power-of-ownership">The Self-Hosted Model: The Power of Ownership<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas#the-self-hosted-model-the-power-of-ownership" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Self-Hosted Model: The Power of Ownership" title="Direct link to The Self-Hosted Model: The Power of Ownership" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>A self-hosted platform like plugNmeet flips the cost model on its head. Instead of paying rent, you are making a capital investment in an asset you own and control.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-visible-costs-1">The Visible Costs:<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas#the-visible-costs-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Visible Costs:" title="Direct link to The Visible Costs:" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> The primary cost is the server hardware (or virtual machine) where the software runs. This could be a cloud server from a provider like DigitalOcean, AWS, or Azure, or your own on-premise hardware.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Initial Setup:</strong> A small, one-time investment of engineering time to install and configure the platform.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-long-term-savings-where-tco-shines">The Long-Term Savings (Where TCO Shines):<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas#the-long-term-savings-where-tco-shines" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Long-Term Savings (Where TCO Shines):" title="Direct link to The Long-Term Savings (Where TCO Shines):" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Predictable, Fixed Costs:</strong> Your main cost is the server, which is a predictable monthly or annual fee. Whether you have 10 users or 1,000 users, this cost does not change. You can serve more users for the same price, rewarding your growth instead of penalizing it.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>No Per-User Fees, Ever:</strong> With open-source software, there are no license fees. You can add as many users, hosts, and rooms as your hardware can support without your bill going up.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Full API Access Included:</strong> All APIs and webhooks are included. You can build deep, complex integrations without worrying about metered billing for API calls.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>You Own the Brand:</strong> Every meeting reinforces your brand, building customer trust and brand equity. This is an invaluable marketing asset.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Self-Hosted TCO is primarily a predictable infrastructure cost that remains flat as your user base grows.</strong></p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="a-simple-tco-comparison">A Simple TCO Comparison<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas#a-simple-tco-comparison" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Simple TCO Comparison" title="Direct link to A Simple TCO Comparison" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Imagine a company with 50 hosts.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>SaaS Model:</strong> At $15/host/month, the cost is <strong>$9,000 per year</strong>. If they grow to 100 hosts, the cost doubles to <strong>$18,000 per year</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Self-Hosted Model:</strong> A capable cloud server might cost $80/month, totaling <strong>$960 per year</strong>. If they grow to 100 hosts, the cost remains <strong>$960 per year</strong> (assuming the server can handle the load, which a modern server often can).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The savings are not just significant; they are exponential as you scale.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Choosing a video platform is a long-term strategic decision. While the immediate simplicity of SaaS is appealing, its rental model can become a significant financial burden that limits growth and brand control.</p>
<p>Self-hosting with a platform like plugNmeet requires a small upfront investment in setup, but it pays massive dividends over time. It provides a predictable, scalable, and strategically sound financial model that puts you in control of your costs, your brand, and your future.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With our major UI redesign on the horizon, we're also excited to unveil a feature that will fundamentally change how you experience meetings: the AI Meeting Assistant.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With our major <a class="" href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/plugnmeet-next-generation">UI redesign on the horizon</a>, we're also excited to unveil a feature that will fundamentally change how you experience meetings: the <strong>AI Meeting Assistant</strong>.</p>
<p>We've all been there: you're trying to lead a discussion while frantically typing notes, only to miss a key decision. Or you join a meeting late and have no idea what's going on. The AI Meeting Assistant solves this problem forever by acting as your personal scribe, powered by <strong>Google's Gemini Pro</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn't just a tech demo; it's a powerful productivity tool built on a sophisticated, cost-effective architecture.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="your-ai-powered-meeting-scribe">Your AI-Powered Meeting Scribe<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/ai-meeting-assistant-automated-summaries#your-ai-powered-meeting-scribe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your AI-Powered Meeting Scribe" title="Direct link to Your AI-Powered Meeting Scribe" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When you enable the AI Assistant for a session, it silently goes to work. By creating a lightweight, audio-only recording of the meeting, the Insights Platform can generate two powerful assets for you:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>A Full, Time-Stamped Transcription (VTT File):</strong> You can enable speech-to-text processing to generate a detailed transcription of the entire conversation in the standard VTT format. This is perfect for creating closed captions for a video recording or for maintaining a searchable, word-for-word archive of the meeting.</li>
<li class=""><strong>An Intelligent Summary:</strong> Using the audio, our asynchronous <code>StartBatchSummarizeAudioFile</code> process sends the data to Gemini to generate a high-level summary, identify key decisions, and list action items.</li>
</ol>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-caution admonition_GHMq alert alert--warning"><div class="admonitionHeading_IUER"><span class="admonitionIcon_blNX"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8.893 1.5c-.183-.31-.52-.5-.887-.5s-.703.19-.886.5L.138 13.499a.98.98 0 0 0 0 1.001c.193.31.53.501.886.501h13.964c.367 0 .704-.19.877-.5a1.03 1.03 0 0 0 .01-1.002L8.893 1.5zm.133 11.497H6.987v-2.003h2.039v2.003zm0-3.004H6.987V5.987h2.039v4.006z"></path></svg></span>A Note on End-to-End Encryption</div><div class="admonitionContent_GUJR"><p>The AI Meeting Assistant requires access to the meeting's audio to function.

<li class="">Live Speech-to-Text &amp; Transcription</li>
<li class="">Spoken Translations (Text-to-Speech)</li>
<li class="">AI-Powered Meeting Summaries</li>
</ul><p>This is a deliberate security design. It ensures that when you choose maximum privacy with E2EE, no service—not even our AI assistant—can access the content of your conversation.</p></div></div>

<p>The real power of the Insights Platform is what happens next. All of this generated data is available to you through the new <strong>Artifacts API</strong>. Instead of being trapped, your meeting intelligence becomes a programmable asset.</p>
<p>With a simple API call, you can retrieve:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">The full meeting summary and action items.</li>
<li class="">The detailed, time-stamped <strong>VTT transcription file</strong>.</li>
<li class="">Token usage data for cost analysis and tracking.</li>
<li class="">Speech duration and other metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows you to build powerful integrations, such as automatically sending meeting summaries to your project management tool or using the VTT file to add captions to your video recordings.</p>

<p>The launch of the AI Meeting Assistant is a huge leap forward. With the core summarization engine and the Artifacts API now in place, our next step is to build the user-facing interfaces to view, edit, and share these automated meeting notes.</p>
<p>We're incredibly excited about the future of intelligent, productive communication in Plug-N-Meet.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you've ever taught a class online, you've likely experienced this frustrating moment. You're in the middle of a great discussion, and you want to illustrate a point on a whiteboard. You click the "whiteboard" button, and suddenly, a completely new application opens up in another window.</p>
<p>It has a different design, a different set of tools, and it feels... disconnected. Your students are now looking at a separate program, not your classroom. This is the "plugin" approach, and while it works, it's often clunky and unintuitive.</p>
<p>At plugNmeet, we believe your tools should feel like a natural part of your classroom, not a separate gadget you have to bolt on. That's why our whiteboard is <strong>truly built-in</strong>, designed from the ground up to be a seamless and powerful part of your teaching experience.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-problem-with-plugin-whiteboards">The Problem with "Plugin" Whiteboards<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience#the-problem-with-plugin-whiteboards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Problem with &quot;Plugin&quot; Whiteboards" title="Direct link to The Problem with &quot;Plugin&quot; Whiteboards" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Many video platforms integrate a whiteboard by simply linking to an external tool, like Google Jamboard or Miro. This creates several problems for teachers and students:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>A Jarring Experience:</strong> Switching to a new window or tab breaks the flow of the lesson and can confuse students.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Limited Features:</strong> Often, these external tools don't work properly in smaller "breakout rooms," limiting your ability to run group activities.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Lag and Delays:</strong> Because the tool is running separately, there can be a noticeable delay between when you draw something and when your students see it.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Lack of Control:</strong> The controls for the whiteboard are separate from your main meeting controls, making it harder to manage your classroom effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="the-plugnmeet-difference-a-truly-native-tool">The plugNmeet Difference: A Truly Native Tool<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience#the-plugnmeet-difference-a-truly-native-tool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The plugNmeet Difference: A Truly Native Tool" title="Direct link to The plugNmeet Difference: A Truly Native Tool" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>We didn't just add a link to a whiteboard. We built one directly into the heart of plugNmeet. Here’s why that makes all the difference for you as an educator.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="1-it-feels-instant-and-seamless">1. It Feels Instant and Seamless<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience#1-it-feels-instant-and-seamless" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. It Feels Instant and Seamless" title="Direct link to 1. It Feels Instant and Seamless" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Because our whiteboard is part of the core application, every line you draw appears on your students' screens instantly. There's no frustrating lag. This is possible because our unique architecture is built for speed, ensuring everyone is always on the same page, literally.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="2-its-more-than-a-blank-canvas">2. It’s More Than a Blank Canvas<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience#2-its-more-than-a-blank-canvas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. It’s More Than a Blank Canvas" title="Direct link to 2. It’s More Than a Blank Canvas" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>A classroom whiteboard isn't just for drawing. It's for reviewing work. We built this directly into our tool. You can <strong>upload PDF documents and Office files</strong> right onto the canvas. This allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Display a worksheet and have students circle the answers together.</li>
<li class="">Pull up a presentation slide and highlight key points.</li>
<li class="">Review a student's paper and add notes directly on the document.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="3-you-have-real-classroom-control">3. You Have Real Classroom Control<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience#3-you-have-real-classroom-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. You Have Real Classroom Control" title="Direct link to 3. You Have Real Classroom Control" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>As a teacher, you need control. Our built-in whiteboard gives you simple, powerful moderation tools with a single click:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Lock the board</strong> to make it "view-only" while you are presenting.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Allow any student</strong> to draw and add to the board.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Enable multi-user drawing</strong> so the entire class can brainstorm together.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="4-it-works-everywhere-especially-in-breakout-rooms">4. It Works Everywhere, Especially in Breakout Rooms<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience#4-it-works-everywhere-especially-in-breakout-rooms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. It Works Everywhere, Especially in Breakout Rooms" title="Direct link to 4. It Works Everywhere, Especially in Breakout Rooms" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is one of the biggest differences. Unlike other platforms where advanced tools often disappear in breakout rooms, our whiteboard retains its full power. Students can work together on documents, solve problems, and brainstorm on their own collaborative canvas in each breakout room, just as they would in the main session.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="conclusion-the-best-tool-is-the-one-you-dont-notice">Conclusion: The Best Tool is the One You Don't Notice<a href="https://www.plugnmeet.org/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience#conclusion-the-best-tool-is-the-one-you-dont-notice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion: The Best Tool is the One You Don't Notice" title="Direct link to Conclusion: The Best Tool is the One You Don't Notice" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Our philosophy is simple: your teaching tools shouldn't get in your way. They should feel so natural and integrated that you don't even think about them.</p>
<p>By building our whiteboard as a core, native feature, we've created a fast, powerful, and seamless collaborative space that truly belongs in your classroom. It’s not an add-on or a plugin; it's simply part of the room.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For most businesses, video conferencing is a utility, like electricity or water. You sign up for a service like Zoom or Google Meet, pay a monthly fee, and use it for your internal meetings. You are, in effect, <strong>renting</strong> your video solution. And for many use cases, that's perfectly fine.</p>
<p>But what happens when video is more than just a utility? What happens when it's a core part of your <strong>product</strong>, your <strong>customer experience</strong>, or your <strong>brand identity</strong>?</p>
<p>Suddenly, renting becomes a strategic liability. You're building a critical part of your business on a platform you don't control, using an interface that looks just like your competitors', and sending your valuable user data to a third party.</p>
<p>This is why smart businesses are moving from renting their video solution to <strong>owning it</strong>.

<p>Using a public SaaS video provider for a customer-facing product seems easy at first, but it comes with significant hidden costs.</p>

<p>When you send a customer to a standard Zoom meeting, you are reinforcing Zoom's brand, not your own. The user experience is generic and identical to the one your competitors are using. You have no ability to create a unique, memorable interaction that feels like a seamless part of your product.</p>

<p>Every time your users interact with the video service, they are generating valuable data: who is talking to whom, for how long, what features are they using? When you use a third-party platform, you are handing all of these valuable insights over to them. You lose the ability to analyze this data to improve your own product.</p>

<p>Integration with a public SaaS platform is often limited to a superficial API. You can create users and schedule meetings, but you can't deeply change the user experience. You're forced to embed their client in a restrictive <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, and you have no control over the layout, the workflow, or the underlying features.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="4-your-costs-are-unpredictable-and-escalate">4.

<p>Per-user, per-month, or per-minute pricing models are manageable at a small scale, but they become incredibly expensive as your business grows. Your success is penalized with escalating costs, and you have no control over future price increases.</p>

<p>By self-hosting a platform like plugNmeet, you flip the script. You move from being a tenant to being the owner.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="1-video-becomes-a-native-feature-not-a-link">1.

Video Becomes a Native Feature, Not a Link" title="Direct link to 1. Video Becomes a Native Feature, Not a Link" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Instead of sending users to an external link, the video experience happens directly within your own application. It feels like a native, integrated feature, creating a seamless and professional user journey that you control from start to finish.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_bX8q" id="2-you-own-the-brand-experience">2.

You Own the Brand Experience" title="Direct link to 2. You Own the Brand Experience" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>With deep customization capabilities, you can style every aspect of the video client to perfectly match your brand's look and feel. The colors, the fonts, the layout—it all becomes <em>your</em> experience, reinforcing your brand and building user trust.</p>

<p>Because the entire platform runs on your own servers, all data and analytics are yours. You can analyze usage patterns, understand user behavior, and gain valuable insights to build a better product, all without ever compromising your users' privacy.</p>

<p>With a self-hosted solution, your cost is the server infrastructure it runs on. This cost is predictable and does not scale with the number of users you have. You can grow your business without worrying about runaway licensing fees.</p>

<p>The choice is simple. If video is just a tool for internal team meetings, renting is a perfectly valid strategy.</p>
<p>But if video is a core part of how you serve your customers, deliver your product, or express your brand, then <strong>owning the platform is the only viable long-term strategy.</strong></p>
<p>Owning your video stack allows you to build a defensible, unique, and cost-effective competitive advantage. Platforms like plugNmeet provide the open-source foundation to make this ownership a reality, giving you the power of a production-ready video platform without sacrificing control.</p>
