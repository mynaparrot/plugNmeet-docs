In a world increasingly reliant on video calls, how do you ensure everyone can still participate, even if they can&#x27;t join online?</p>
<p>At Plug-N-Meet, we believe in inclusivity. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re excited to introduce <strong>SIP Dial-In</strong>, a powerful feature that allows participants to join the audio of your video meetings using any standard telephone. No internet, no problem.</p>
<p>This feature seamlessly bridges the gap between your online conference and the traditional telephone network, ensuring that every voice can be heard, regardless of their connectivity.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_VAKv padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/sip">sip</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/voip">voip</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/telephony">telephony</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/integration">integration</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/accessibility">accessibility</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/feature">feature</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/moderator">moderator</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/admin">admin</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Bridging the Gap: How SIP Dial-In Connects Your Meetings to Any Phone" href="/blog/sip-dial-in-for-video-conferencing"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ndl5"><a href="/blog/bigbluebutton-vs-plugnmeet-alternative">BigBlueButton vs. Plug-N-Meet: A Modern Alternative for Scalable Video Conferencing</a></h2><div class="container_iT3w margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2026-01-18T00:00:00.000Z">January 18, 2026</time> · <!-- -->7 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Ve2T"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pjAe" src="https://github.com/saimonzone.png" alt="Chaboud Simon"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_YML7"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_mzLN" translate="no">Chaboud Simon</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_SoHM" title="Community &amp; Marketing Lead">Community &amp; Marketing Lead</small><div class="authorSocials_OsyH"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>If you&#x27;re in the world of open-source education or communication, you owe a debt of gratitude to BigBlueButton.

Perhaps you&#x27;re a power user who wants to create a professional presentation with multiple cameras, overlays, and smooth transitions using a tool like OBS Studio.</p>
<p>Traditionally, getting this kind of professional content into a live meeting has been complex or impossible.</p>
<p>At plugNmeet, we believe you should be able to use the best tools for the job. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve built a simple but powerful feature called <strong>Live Stream Input</strong>. Think of it as giving your meeting its own private, secure TV channel. You can broadcast directly into your meeting room from professional software like OBS, and your stream appears as a regular participant.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_VAKv padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/obs">obs</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/streaming">streaming</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/rtmp">rtmp</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/whip">whip</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/features">features</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/ease-of-use">ease-of-use</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/professional">professional</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Stream Like a Pro: How to Bring OBS into Your plugNmeet Room" href="/blog/obs-rtmp-whip-ingress"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ndl5"><a href="/blog/smart-video-streaming">A Smoother Call on Any Connection: Our Smart Approach to Video Streaming</a></h2><div class="container_iT3w margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-12-27T00:00:00.000Z">December 27, 2025</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Ve2T"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/jibon57" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pjAe" src="https://github.com/jibon57.png" alt="Jibon L.

<p>When we built Plug-N-Meet, we didn&#x27;t just want to create another video conferencing tool. We wanted to build a platform that respects the user&#x27;s right to privacy by default. This meant making hard architectural choices—prioritizing security over easy data harvesting, and giving control back to the user rather than hoarding it on the server.</p>
<p>If you are building a telehealth platform, a legal consultation app, or simply a secure meeting space for your team, you need more than just a &quot;secure&quot; sticker. You need an architecture designed for the Zero-Trust era.</p>

<p>This article will demystify the relationship between scalability and HA, and guide you through a pragmatic, phased approach to optimizing your plugNmeet deployment.

The answer is often more complex than just the number on your monthly bill.</p>
<p>For businesses evaluating a video platform, the choice between a public SaaS provider (like Zoom or Google Meet) and a self-hosted solution (like plugNmeet) often comes down to a calculation of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). While SaaS pricing seems simple at first, it hides long-term costs that can stifle growth. Conversely, self-hosting has a different cost structure—one that offers predictability, control, and significant savings at scale.</p>
<p>This article will break down the true TCO of both models to help you make a smarter, more strategic decision.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_VAKv padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/business">business</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/strategy">strategy</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/saas">saas</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/open-source">open-source</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/cost">cost</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/tco">tco</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/pricing">pricing</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about The True Cost of Video: Calculating the TCO of Self-Hosting vs. SaaS" href="/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ndl5"><a href="/blog/ai-meeting-assistant-automated-summaries">Introducing the AI Meeting Assistant: Automated Notes and Summaries</a></h2><div class="container_iT3w margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-12-02T00:00:00.000Z">December 2, 2025</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Ve2T"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/jibon57" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pjAe" src="https://github.com/jibon57.png" alt="Jibon L.

That&#x27;s why our whiteboard is <strong>truly built-in</strong>, designed from the ground up to be a seamless and powerful part of your teaching experience.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_VAKv padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/whiteboard">whiteboard</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/collaboration">collaboration</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/ease-of-use">ease-of-use</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/user-experience">user-experience</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/edtech">edtech</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/features">features</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about A Whiteboard That Belongs in the Classroom, Not in Another Tab" href="/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ndl5"><a href="/blog/own-vs-rent-video-platform">Don&#x27;t Just Rent Your Video Solution, Own It: The Business Case for Self-Hosting</a></h2><div class="container_iT3w margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-11-25T00:00:00.000Z">November 25, 2025</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Ve2T"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pjAe" src="https://github.com/saimonzone.png" alt="Chaboud Simon"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_YML7"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_mzLN" translate="no">Chaboud Simon</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_SoHM" title="Community &amp; Marketing Lead">Community &amp; Marketing Lead</small><div class="authorSocials_OsyH"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>For most businesses, video conferencing is a utility, like electricity or water. You sign up for a service like Zoom or Google Meet, pay a monthly fee, and use it for your internal meetings. You are, in effect, <strong>renting</strong> your video solution. And for many use cases, that&#x27;s perfectly fine.</p>
<p>But what happens when video is more than just a utility? What happens when it&#x27;s a core part of your <strong>product</strong>, your <strong>customer experience</strong>, or your <strong>brand identity</strong>?</p>
<p>Suddenly, renting becomes a strategic liability. You&#x27;re building a critical part of your business on a platform you don&#x27;t control, using an interface that looks just like your competitors&#x27;, and sending your valuable user data to a third party.</p>
<p>This is why smart businesses are moving from renting their video solution to <strong>owning it</strong>. By leveraging powerful, self-hosted platforms like <strong>plugNmeet</strong>, they are transforming video from a simple utility into a strategic asset and a powerful competitive advantage.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_VAKv padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/business">business</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/strategy">strategy</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/saas">saas</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/open-source">open-source</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/white-label">white-label</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/data-privacy">data-privacy</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Don&#x27;t Just Rent Your Video Solution, Own It: The Business Case for Self-Hosting" href="/blog/own-vs-rent-video-platform"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ndl5"><a href="/blog/no-installation-browser-first-philosophy">Click a Link, Join a Meeting: The &quot;No Installation&quot; Philosophy</a></h2><div class="container_iT3w margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z">November 22, 2025</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Ve2T"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/wbobteng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pjAe" src="https://github.com/wbobteng.png" alt="Bob Teng"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_YML7"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/wbobteng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_mzLN" translate="no">Bob Teng</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_SoHM" title="Developer Advocate">Developer Advocate</small><div class="authorSocials_OsyH"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Think about the last time a new application asked you to &quot;download and install&quot; something.

<p>At plugNmeet, we believe that joining a video meeting should be as simple and frictionless as visiting a website. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve built our entire platform around a core philosophy: <strong>No installation required.</strong></p>

<p>In a physical classroom, a teacher can read the room. Online, they are often flying blind.</p>
<p>At plugNmeet, we believe that data, when used ethically and transparently, can provide the insights needed to transform this black box into a blueprint for better teaching. Our built-in analytics feature is designed not as a surveillance tool, but as a source of raw material to help you evaluate and improve your virtual classroom performance. And we&#x27;ve built it with a &quot;privacy-by-default&quot; philosophy.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_VAKv padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/analytics">analytics</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/lms">lms</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/privacy">privacy</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/edtech">edtech</a></li><li class="tag_DMXu"><a rel="tag" class="tag_YBtS tagRegular_np3p" href="/blog/tags/data-driven">data-driven</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about From Black Box to Blueprint: Using Analytics to Understand Your Online Classroom" href="/blog/classroom-analytics-for-educators"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ndl5"><a href="/blog/embed-web-content-dynamic-collaboration">Bring the Web into Your Meeting: Seamlessly Embed Websites and Apps for Dynamic Collaboration</a></h2><div class="container_iT3w margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-11-17T00:00:00.000Z">November 17, 2025</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Ve2T"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/wbobteng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pjAe" src="https://github.com/wbobteng.png" alt="Bob Teng"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_YML7"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/wbobteng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_mzLN" translate="no">Bob Teng</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_SoHM" title="Developer Advocate">Developer Advocate</small><div class="authorSocials_OsyH"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>How many times have you been in an online meeting where the presenter says, &quot;Okay, I&#x27;m going to share my screen now... wait, let me find the right tab... can you all see this?

<p>This constant switching, sharing, and re-sharing breaks the flow, distracts participants, and turns what should be a dynamic collaboration into a clunky, disjointed experience. Your meeting becomes a series of disconnected windows, not a unified workspace.</p>
<p>At Plug-N-Meet, we believe your meeting room should be as versatile as your web browser.

It’s a fantastic way to get started, but to build a truly professional and seamless product, you need to go deeper.</p>
<p>An <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is a box. It isolates the meeting client from your main application, creating a visible separation that can feel clunky and limit your branding potential.</p>
