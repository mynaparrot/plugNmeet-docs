complex e-commerce empire. But when it comes to one of the most critical forms of modern communication—live video—many site owners hit a wall. You&#x27;re often left juggling clunky Zoom links, sending your users to third-party platforms, and sacrificing the professional, branded experience your website was designed to provide.</p>
<p>What if you could integrate a powerful, secure, and fully-branded video conferencing solution directly into your WordPress site as easily as you add a new page?</p>
<p>This is not just possible; it&#x27;s simple. This guide will show you how to use the <strong>Plug-N-Meet plugin</strong> to transform your WordPress site into a true communication hub, whether you need a simple meeting room, a platform for webinars, or a full-fledged, monetized video service.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_tKeR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/wordpress">wordpress</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/video-conferencing">video-conferencing</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/plugin">plugin</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/no-code">no-code</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/webinar">webinar</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/coaching">coaching</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/membership">membership</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/wordpress-video-conferencing">wordpress-video-conferencing</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about The Ultimate Guide to WordPress Video Conferencing" href="/blog/wordpress-video-conferencing-guide"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_pS7Q"><a href="/blog/developer-guide-custom-video-chat-ui-headless-api">A Developer&#x27;s Guide to Building a Custom Video Chat UI with Plug-N-Meet&#x27;s Headless API</a></h2><div class="container_DWC_ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2026-02-07T00:00:00.000Z">February 7, 2026</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_xW5H"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/jibon57" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_eq6D" src="https://github.com/jibon57.png" alt="Jibon L.

You can create rooms, generate join tokens, and embed the client in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. It&#x27;s fast and it works. But now you want to go deeper. You want to break out of the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> box and build a truly seamless user experience where the video client feels like a native part of your application&#x27;s UI.</p>
<p>This is where Plug-N-Meet&#x27;s &quot;headless&quot; integration mode comes in.</p>
<p>This guide is for developers who want to move beyond basic embedding. We&#x27;ll show you how to use the powerful <code>getClientFiles</code> API to render the Plug-N-Meet client directly into your own page&#x27;s DOM, giving you ultimate control over layout, branding, and the user experience.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_tKeR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/developer">developer</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/tutorial">tutorial</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/how-to">how-to</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/api">api</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/headless">headless</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/get-client-files">getClientFiles</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/white-label">white-label</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/customization">customization</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/javascript">javascript</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about A Developer&#x27;s Guide to Building a Custom Video Chat UI with Plug-N-Meet&#x27;s Headless API" href="/blog/developer-guide-custom-video-chat-ui-headless-api"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_pS7Q"><a href="/blog/scaling-architecture-saves-money">Scaling Your Video Service: How Plug-N-Meet&#x27;s Architecture Saves You Money</a></h2><div class="container_DWC_ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2026-01-31T00:00:00.000Z">January 31, 2026</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_xW5H"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_eq6D" src="https://github.com/saimonzone.png" alt="Chaboud Simon"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_k_xU"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_uAZk" translate="no">Chaboud Simon</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_AzvG" title="Community &amp; Marketing Lead">Community &amp; Marketing Lead</small><div class="authorSocials_LCU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Your video service is a hit.

In a world increasingly reliant on video calls, how do you ensure everyone can still participate, even if they can&#x27;t join online?</p>
<p>At Plug-N-Meet, we believe in inclusivity. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re excited to introduce <strong>SIP Dial-In</strong>, a powerful feature that allows participants to join the audio of your video meetings using any standard telephone. No internet, no problem.</p>
<p>This feature seamlessly bridges the gap between your online conference and the traditional telephone network, ensuring that every voice can be heard, regardless of their connectivity.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_tKeR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/sip">sip</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/voip">voip</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/telephony">telephony</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/integration">integration</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/accessibility">accessibility</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/feature">feature</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/moderator">moderator</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/admin">admin</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Bridging the Gap: How SIP Dial-In Connects Your Meetings to Any Phone" href="/blog/sip-dial-in-for-video-conferencing"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_pS7Q"><a href="/blog/bigbluebutton-vs-plugnmeet-alternative">BigBlueButton vs. Plug-N-Meet: A Modern Alternative for Scalable Video Conferencing</a></h2><div class="container_DWC_ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2026-01-18T00:00:00.000Z">January 18, 2026</time> · <!-- -->7 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_xW5H"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_eq6D" src="https://github.com/saimonzone.png" alt="Chaboud Simon"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_k_xU"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/saimonzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_uAZk" translate="no">Chaboud Simon</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_AzvG" title="Community &amp; Marketing Lead">Community &amp; Marketing Lead</small><div class="authorSocials_LCU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>If you&#x27;re in the world of open-source education or communication, you owe a debt of gratitude to BigBlueButton.

It must be the foundation.</p>
<p>When we built Plug-N-Meet, we didn&#x27;t just want to create another video conferencing tool. We wanted to build a platform that respects the user&#x27;s right to privacy by default. This meant making hard architectural choices—prioritizing security over easy data harvesting, and giving control back to the user rather than hoarding it on the server.</p>
<p>If you are building a telehealth platform, a legal consultation app, or simply a secure meeting space for your team, you need more than just a &quot;secure&quot; sticker. You need an architecture designed for the Zero-Trust era.</p>
<p>Here is how Plug-N-Meet delivers on that promise.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_tKeR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/privacy">privacy</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/security">security</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/zero-trust">zero-trust</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/e-2-ee">e2ee</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/open-source">open-source</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/architecture">architecture</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/gdpr">gdpr</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Privacy by Design: Why Plug-N-Meet is Built for the Zero-Trust Era" href="/blog/privacy-by-design-zero-trust"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_pS7Q"><a href="/blog/smart-scaling-ha-recorder">Smart Scaling: Leveraging Cloud HA and Prioritizing Your Recorder for Cost-Effective Performance</a></h2><div class="container_DWC_ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-12-14T00:00:00.000Z">December 14, 2025</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_xW5H"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/jibon57" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_eq6D" src="https://github.com/jibon57.png" alt="Jibon L.

But for many, these terms conjure images of complex, multi-node clusters, expensive infrastructure, and a steep learning curve. The truth is, for most plugNmeet users, achieving both performance and resilience can be much simpler and more cost-effective than you might think.</p>
<p>This article will demystify the relationship between scalability and HA, and guide you through a pragmatic, phased approach to optimizing your plugNmeet deployment. We&#x27;ll show you how to leverage the power of your cloud provider for HA, and why separating your recording server is almost always your first and best step towards true scalability.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_tKeR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/scalability">scalability</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/high-availability">high-availability</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/ha">ha</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/cloud">cloud</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/cost-effective">cost-effective</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/recorder">recorder</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/deployment">deployment</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/architecture">architecture</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Smart Scaling: Leveraging Cloud HA and Prioritizing Your Recorder for Cost-Effective Performance" href="/blog/smart-scaling-ha-recorder"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_pS7Q"><a href="/blog/powerful-workflows-with-webhooks">Automate Everything: 5 Powerful Workflows You Can Build with plugNmeet Webhooks</a></h2><div class="container_DWC_ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-12-07T00:00:00.000Z">December 7, 2025</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_xW5H"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/jibon57" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_eq6D" src="https://github.com/jibon57.png" alt="Jibon L.

The answer is often more complex than just the number on your monthly bill.</p>
<p>For businesses evaluating a video platform, the choice between a public SaaS provider (like Zoom or Google Meet) and a self-hosted solution (like plugNmeet) often comes down to a calculation of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). While SaaS pricing seems simple at first, it hides long-term costs that can stifle growth. Conversely, self-hosting has a different cost structure—one that offers predictability, control, and significant savings at scale.</p>
<p>This article will break down the true TCO of both models to help you make a smarter, more strategic decision.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_tKeR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/business">business</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/strategy">strategy</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/saas">saas</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/open-source">open-source</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/cost">cost</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/tco">tco</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/pricing">pricing</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about The True Cost of Video: Calculating the TCO of Self-Hosting vs. SaaS" href="/blog/tco-self-hosting-vs-saas"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_pS7Q"><a href="/blog/ai-meeting-assistant-automated-summaries">Introducing the AI Meeting Assistant: Automated Notes and Summaries</a></h2><div class="container_DWC_ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-12-02T00:00:00.000Z">December 2, 2025</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_xW5H"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/jibon57" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_eq6D" src="https://github.com/jibon57.png" alt="Jibon L.

And for many use cases, that&#x27;s perfectly fine.</p>
<p>But what happens when video is more than just a utility? What happens when it&#x27;s a core part of your <strong>product</strong>, your <strong>customer experience</strong>, or your <strong>brand identity</strong>?</p>
<p>Suddenly, renting becomes a strategic liability. You&#x27;re building a critical part of your business on a platform you don&#x27;t control, using an interface that looks just like your competitors&#x27;, and sending your valuable user data to a third party.</p>

<p>This isn&#x27;t just a convenience; it&#x27;s a deliberate design choice that leads to a more secure, more private, and fundamentally better user experience for everyone.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_tKeR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/ease-of-use">ease-of-use</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/browser">browser</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/privacy">privacy</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/security">security</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/user-experience">user-experience</a></li><li class="tag_meuk"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zjsv tagRegular_k1E_" href="/blog/tags/e-2-ee">e2ee</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Click a Link, Join a Meeting: The &quot;No Installation&quot; Philosophy" href="/blog/no-installation-browser-first-philosophy"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Quick links</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Docs</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/api/intro">API</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.plugnmeet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Cloud<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-label="(opens in new tab)" class="iconExternalLink__Nq8"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Forum<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-label="(opens in new tab)" class="iconExternalLink__Nq8"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.gg/2X2ZaCHu4C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord chat<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-label="(opens in new tab)" class="iconExternalLink__Nq8"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-label="(opens in new tab)" class="iconExternalLink__Nq8"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Demo<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-label="(opens in new tab)" class="iconExternalLink__Nq8"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2026 MynaParrot SL.</div></div></div></footer></div>
