This is the power of webhooks. They are the key to transforming a simple video conferencing tool into a deeply integrated and automated part of your business ecosystem.\\n\\nplugNmeet provides a rich set of webhook events that fire in real-time as things happen inside a meeting. By listening for these events, you can build powerful, automated workflows that save time, reduce manual work, and create a smarter application.\\n\\nThis article will explore five practical examples of workflows you can build today with plugNmeet webhooks.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What Are Webhooks?\\n\\nIn simple terms, a webhook is a notification. You provide plugNmeet with a URL, and when a specific event occurs (like a user joining a room or a recording finishing processing), our server sends a POST request with a JSON payload of data to your URL. Your application can then use this data to trigger any action you can imagine.\\n\\nLet\'s dive into the examples.\\n\\n### 1. The Smart Sales Demo: CRM Integration\\n\\n**The Goal:** Automatically log every sales demo in your CRM and notify the sales team when a high-value lead joins the call.\\n\\n*   **The Trigger:** `participant_joined` event.\\n*   **The Workflow:**\\n    1.  When a participant joins a room, your webhook endpoint receives their `participant.user_id` and `participant.name`.\\n    2.  Your server looks up this user in your CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot).\\n    3.  If the user is a known lead, you update their CRM record with a new activity: \\"Attended sales demo in room `[room.room_id]`.\\"\\n    4.  If the lead has a high deal value, you can even send a real-time Slack notification to the account owner: \\"\ud83d\udd25 High-value lead \'John Doe\' just joined the demo!\\"\\n\\n### 2. The Automated Classroom: Attendance Tracking\\n\\n**The Goal:** Automatically take attendance for an online class and mark students as present or absent in your Learning Management System (LMS).\\n\\n*   **The Triggers:** `participant_joined` and `participant_left` events.\\n*   **The Workflow:**\\n    1.  Your webhook endpoint listens for join and leave events for a specific classroom session.\\n    2.  It logs the `participant.user_id` and timestamps for each event.\\n    3.  At the end of the session (triggered by the `room_finished` event), your server processes the logs. It calculates the total duration each student was present.\\n    4.  It then makes an API call to your LMS to automatically mark students as \\"Present,\\" \\"Absent,\\" or \\"Tardy\\" based on your defined business logic (e.g., present if they attended >80% of the session).\\n\\n### 3. The Content Pipeline: Automatic Recording Archival\\n\\n**The Goal:** Create a seamless pipeline that takes a finished recording, transcribes it, and uploads it to a secure, long-term storage location.\\n\\n*   **The Trigger:** `end_recording` event.\\n*   **The Workflow:**\\n    1.  When a recording has finished processing, your webhook endpoint receives a payload containing the `recording_info.record_id` and a link to the final MP4 file.\\n    2.  Your server can then download this file.\\n    3.  (Optional) You can send the audio track to a transcription service (like AWS Transcribe or Deepgram) to generate a text transcript.\\n    4.  Finally, your server uploads both the MP4 video and the text transcript to a secure, long-term storage solution like Amazon S3 or a private file server, and deletes the original from the plugNmeet server to save space.\\n\\n### 4. The Collaborative Review: Screen Share Notifications\\n\\n**The Goal:** In a collaborative design review or code review session, automatically notify a project management tool or a Slack channel when a participant starts sharing their screen, creating a timeline of key presentation moments.\\n\\n*   **The Trigger:** `track_published` event.\\n*   **The Workflow:**\\n    1.  Your webhook endpoint listens for the `track_published` event.\\n    2.  You check the `track.source` in the event payload. If the `track.source` is `SCREEN_SHARE`, you know a user has just started a screen share.\\n    3.  Your server can then make an API call to your project management tool (like Jira or Asana) to add a comment to a specific task: \\"User \'[participant.name]\' started a screen share at `[createdAt]`.\\"\\n    4.  Alternatively, you could post a message to a dedicated Slack channel: \\"\ud83d\udcfa \'[participant.name]\' is now presenting their screen in the design review meeting.\\" This creates a real-time log of when different team members presented.\\n\\n### 5. The Billing Engine: Pay-per-Minute Access\\n\\n**The Goal:** Build a service where users pay for the time they spend in a consultation or premium event.\\n\\n*   **The Triggers:** `participant_joined` and `participant_left` events.\\n*   **The Workflow:**\\n    1.  When a participant joins a premium room, your webhook logs the `participant.user_id` and the `createdAt` timestamp.\\n    2.  When they leave, the `participant_left` event provides the `createdAt` timestamp for their departure.\\n    3.  Your server calculates the total duration in minutes.\\n    4.  This duration is then used to make an API call to your billing system (like Stripe or Paddle) to either decrement a user\'s pre-purchased credits or charge their account for the time used.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: Your Imagination is the Only Limit\\n\\nWebhooks transform plugNmeet from a simple meeting tool into a powerful, event-driven platform. They are the glue that allows you to connect your real-time communication layer to every other part of your business.\\n\\nBy listening for the right events, you can automate manual tasks, create smarter workflows, and build a deeply integrated application that feels seamless from start to finish.

The answer is often more complex than just the number on your monthly bill.\\n\\nFor businesses evaluating a video platform, the choice between a public SaaS provider (like Zoom or Google Meet) and a self-hosted solution (like plugNmeet) often comes down to a calculation of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). While SaaS pricing seems simple at first, it hides long-term costs that can stifle growth. Conversely, self-hosting has a different cost structure\u2014one that offers predictability, control, and significant savings at scale.\\n\\nThis article will break down the true TCO of both models to help you make a smarter, more strategic decision.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The SaaS Model: A Story of Escalating Rent\\n\\nThe pricing model for most SaaS video platforms is designed for simplicity and immediate adoption. It\'s typically a per-user, per-month fee. This is the \\"rent\\" you pay for using their service.\\n\\n### The Visible Costs:\\n*   **License Fees:** The obvious cost. For example, $15 per host per month. For a company with 100 hosts, this is a predictable $1,500 every month.\\n\\n### The Hidden Costs (Where TCO Spikes):\\n\\n1.  **The Penalty for Growth:** The per-user model means your costs scale directly with your success. As you hire more employees or serve more customers, your bill goes up in a linear, often painful, way. You are penalized for growing your business.\\n\\n2.  **Overage Charges:** Many plans have limits on meeting duration or number of participants. Exceeding these can result in expensive overage fees.\\n\\n3.  **API & Integration Fees:** Need to integrate the video service with your CRM or scheduling tool? Many providers charge extra for API access, sometimes at a steep per-minute or per-call rate.\\n\\n4.  **Lack of Brand Equity:** This is a strategic cost. Every time a customer joins a meeting, they see the SaaS provider\'s brand, not yours. You are paying to build *their* brand recognition, not your own.\\n\\n**The SaaS TCO is a recurring operational expense (OpEx) that is unpredictable and scales with your user count.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Self-Hosted Model: The Power of Ownership\\n\\nA self-hosted platform like plugNmeet flips the cost model on its head. Instead of paying rent, you are making a capital investment in an asset you own and control.\\n\\n### The Visible Costs:\\n*   **Infrastructure:** The primary cost is the server hardware (or virtual machine) where the software runs. This could be a cloud server from a provider like DigitalOcean, AWS, or Azure, or your own on-premise hardware.\\n*   **Initial Setup:** A small, one-time investment of engineering time to install and configure the platform.\\n\\n### The Long-Term Savings (Where TCO Shines):\\n\\n1.  **Predictable, Fixed Costs:** Your main cost is the server, which is a predictable monthly or annual fee. Whether you have 10 users or 1,000 users, this cost does not change. You can serve more users for the same price, rewarding your growth instead of penalizing it.\\n\\n2.  **No Per-User Fees, Ever:** With open-source software, there are no license fees. You can add as many users, hosts, and rooms as your hardware can support without your bill going up.\\n\\n3.  **Full API Access Included:** All APIs and webhooks are included. You can build deep, complex integrations without worrying about metered billing for API calls.\\n\\n4.  **You Own the Brand:** Every meeting reinforces your brand, building customer trust and brand equity. This is an invaluable marketing asset.\\n\\n**The Self-Hosted TCO is primarily a predictable infrastructure cost that remains flat as your user base grows.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## A Simple TCO Comparison\\n\\nImagine a company with 50 hosts.\\n\\n*   **SaaS Model:** At $15/host/month, the cost is **$9,000 per year**. If they grow to 100 hosts, the cost doubles to **$18,000 per year**.\\n\\n*   **Self-Hosted Model:** A capable cloud server might cost $80/month, totaling **$960 per year**. If they grow to 100 hosts, the cost remains **$960 per year** (assuming the server can handle the load, which a modern server often can).\\n\\nThe savings are not just significant; they are exponential as you scale.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nChoosing a video platform is a long-term strategic decision. While the immediate simplicity of SaaS is appealing, its rental model can become a significant financial burden that limits growth and brand control.\\n\\nSelf-hosting with a platform like plugNmeet requires a small upfront investment in setup, but it pays massive dividends over time. It provides a predictable, scalable, and strategically sound financial model that puts you in control of your costs, your brand, and your future.\\n\\n---\\n**Ready to take control of your video conferencing budget?**\\n\\n*   **Explore our [Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**\\n*   **Read our [Scalable Deployment Guide](/docs/developer-guide/scalable-setup)**\\n*   **Check out our [Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**"},{"id":"ai-meeting-assistant-automated-summaries","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/ai-meeting-assistant-automated-summaries","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-12-02-plugnmeet-insights-platform-real-time-translation.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-02-plugnmeet-insights-platform-real-time-translation.md","title":"Introducing the AI Meeting Assistant: Automated Notes and Summaries","description":"With our major UI redesign on the horizon, we\'re also excited to unveil a feature that will fundamentally change how you experience meetings: the AI Meeting Assistant.","date":"2025-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"meeting-summary","permalink":"/blog/tags/meeting-summary"},{"inline":true,"label":"note-taker","permalink":"/blog/tags/note-taker"},{"inline":true,"label":"gemini","permalink":"/blog/tags/gemini"},{"inline":true,"label":"developer","permalink":"/blog/tags/developer"},{"inline":true,"label":"productivity","permalink":"/blog/tags/productivity"},{"inline":true,"label":"insights","permalink":"/blog/tags/insights"},{"inline":true,"label":"artifacts","permalink":"/blog/tags/artifacts"}],"readingTime":4.08,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jibon L.

Or you join a meeting late and have no idea what\'s going on. The AI Meeting Assistant solves this problem forever by acting as your personal scribe, powered by **Google\'s Gemini Pro**.\\n\\nThis isn\'t just a tech demo; it\'s a powerful productivity tool built on a sophisticated, cost-effective architecture.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Your AI-Powered Meeting Scribe\\n\\nWhen you enable the AI Assistant for a session, it silently goes to work. By creating a lightweight, audio-only recording of the meeting, the Insights Platform can generate two powerful assets for you:\\n\\n1.  **A Full, Time-Stamped Transcription (VTT File):** You can enable speech-to-text processing to generate a detailed transcription of the entire conversation in the standard VTT format. This is perfect for creating closed captions for a video recording or for maintaining a searchable, word-for-word archive of the meeting.\\n2.  **An Intelligent Summary:** Using the audio, our asynchronous `StartBatchSummarizeAudioFile` process sends the data to Gemini to generate a high-level summary, identify key decisions, and list action items.\\n\\n:::caution[A Note on End-to-End Encryption]\\nThe AI Meeting Assistant requires access to the meeting\'s audio to function. If you enable End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) with a self-provided key, the AI agent will be unable to decrypt the audio stream.\\n\\nAs a result, the following features will be **automatically disabled** for that session to protect your privacy:\\n*   Live Speech-to-Text & Transcription\\n*   Spoken Translations (Text-to-Speech)\\n*   AI-Powered Meeting Summaries\\n\\nThis is a deliberate security design. It ensures that when you choose maximum privacy with E2EE, no service\u2014not even our AI assistant\u2014can access the content of your conversation.\\n:::\\n\\n### Unlock Your Meeting Data with the Artifacts API\\n\\nThe real power of the Insights Platform is what happens next. All of this generated data is available to you through the new **Artifacts API**. Instead of being trapped, your meeting intelligence becomes a programmable asset.\\n\\nWith a simple API call, you can retrieve:\\n*   The full meeting summary and action items.\\n*   The detailed, time-stamped **VTT transcription file**.\\n*   Token usage data for cost analysis and tracking.\\n*   Speech duration and other metadata.\\n\\nThis allows you to build powerful integrations, such as automatically sending meeting summaries to your project management tool or using the VTT file to add captions to your video recordings.\\n\\n## The Insights Platform: A Multi-Provider AI Powerhouse\\n\\nThe **Insights Platform** is designed to use the best tool for every job. Instead of locking you into a single vendor, our new provider-agnostic architecture allows us to integrate the world\'s best AI services for each specific task.\\n\\n*   **AI Summarization & Chat:** Powered by **Google Gemini**, providing world-class generative AI capabilities. You have the flexibility to choose between Google\'s powerful `Gemini Pro` for the highest quality summaries, or the faster, more cost-effective `Gemini Flash` model for less critical tasks.\\n*   **Real-Time Translation:** Powered by **Microsoft Azure**, offering robust and affordable speech-to-text and translation services.\\n\\n## An Open Platform for Developers\\n\\nThe power of the Insights Platform comes from its open and flexible architecture. The entire system is built on a set of provider interfaces.\\n\\n```go\\n// Provider is the master interface for all AI services.\\ntype Provider interface {\\n\\t// Azure-powered features\\n\\tCreateTranscription(ctx context.Context, roomId, userId string, options []byte) (TranscriptionStream, error)\\n\\tTranslateText(ctx context.Context, text, sourceLang string, targetLangs []string) (*plugnmeet.InsightsTextTranslationResult, error)\\n\\tSynthesizeText(ctx context.Context, options []byte) (io.ReadCloser, error)\\n\\n\\t// Google Gemini-powered features\\n\\tAITextChatStream(ctx context.Context, chatModel string, history []*plugnmeet.InsightsAITextChatContent) (<-chan *plugnmeet.InsightsAITextChatStreamResult, error)\\n\\tAIChatTextSummarize(ctx context.Context, summarizeModel string, history []*plugnmeet.InsightsAITextChatContent) (summaryText string, promptTokens uint32, completionTokens uint32, err error)\\n\\tStartBatchSummarizeAudioFile(ctx context.Context, filePath, summarizeModel, userPrompt string) (jobId string, fileName string, err error)\\n\\tGetBatchSummarizeResult(ctx context.Context, jobId string) (*plugnmeet.BatchSummarizeResult, error)\\n\\n\\t// Common\\n\\tGetSupportedLanguages(serviceType ServiceType) []*plugnmeet.InsightsSupportedLangInfo\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis modularity gives you the freedom to choose the best provider *and* the best model for each task, giving you unparalleled control over your platform\'s performance and cost.\\n\\n:::warning[Deprecation Notice]\\nThis new, flexible Insights Platform officially deprecates the old, hard-coded speech-to-text feature, which was tied exclusively to Azure.\\n:::\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nThe launch of the AI Meeting Assistant is a huge leap forward. With the core summarization engine and the Artifacts API now in place, our next step is to build the user-facing interfaces to view, edit, and share these automated meeting notes.\\n\\nWe\'re incredibly excited about the future of intelligent, productive communication in Plug-N-Meet.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Ready to upgrade?**\\n\\n*   **[Explore the Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**\\n*   **[Review the API Documentation](/docs/api/intro)**\\n*   **[Check out the Live Demo to see the new UI in action](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**"},{"id":"integrated-whiteboard-experience","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/integrated-whiteboard-experience","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-27-excalidraw-whiteboard-deep-dive.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-27-excalidraw-whiteboard-deep-dive.md","title":"A Whiteboard That Belongs in the Classroom, Not in Another Tab","description":"If you\'ve ever taught a class online, you\'ve likely experienced this frustrating moment.

You\'re in the middle of a great discussion, and you want to illustrate a point on a whiteboard. You click the \\"whiteboard\\" button, and suddenly, a completely new application opens up in another window.\\n\\nIt has a different design, a different set of tools, and it feels... disconnected. Your students are now looking at a separate program, not your classroom. This is the \\"plugin\\" approach, and while it works, it\'s often clunky and unintuitive.\\n\\nAt plugNmeet, we believe your tools should feel like a natural part of your classroom, not a separate gadget you have to bolt on. That\'s why our whiteboard is **truly built-in**, designed from the ground up to be a seamless and powerful part of your teaching experience.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Problem with \\"Plugin\\" Whiteboards\\n\\nMany video platforms integrate a whiteboard by simply linking to an external tool, like Google Jamboard or Miro. This creates several problems for teachers and students:\\n\\n*   **A Jarring Experience:** Switching to a new window or tab breaks the flow of the lesson and can confuse students.\\n*   **Limited Features:** Often, these external tools don\'t work properly in smaller \\"breakout rooms,\\" limiting your ability to run group activities.\\n*   **Lag and Delays:** Because the tool is running separately, there can be a noticeable delay between when you draw something and when your students see it.\\n*   **Lack of Control:** The controls for the whiteboard are separate from your main meeting controls, making it harder to manage your classroom effectively.\\n\\n## The plugNmeet Difference: A Truly Native Tool\\n\\nWe didn\'t just add a link to a whiteboard. We built one directly into the heart of plugNmeet. Here\u2019s why that makes all the difference for you as an educator.\\n\\n### 1. It Feels Instant and Seamless\\nBecause our whiteboard is part of the core application, every line you draw appears on your students\' screens instantly. There\'s no frustrating lag. This is possible because our unique architecture is built for speed, ensuring everyone is always on the same page, literally.\\n\\n### 2. It\u2019s More Than a Blank Canvas\\nA classroom whiteboard isn\'t just for drawing. It\'s for reviewing work. We built this directly into our tool. You can **upload PDF documents and Office files** right onto the canvas. This allows you to:\\n*   Display a worksheet and have students circle the answers together.\\n*   Pull up a presentation slide and highlight key points.\\n*   Review a student\'s paper and add notes directly on the document.\\n\\n### 3. You Have Real Classroom Control\\nAs a teacher, you need control. Our built-in whiteboard gives you simple, powerful moderation tools with a single click:\\n*   **Lock the board** to make it \\"view-only\\" while you are presenting.\\n*   **Allow any student** to draw and add to the board.\\n*   **Enable multi-user drawing** so the entire class can brainstorm together.\\n\\n### 4. It Works Everywhere, Especially in Breakout Rooms\\nThis is one of the biggest differences. Unlike other platforms where advanced tools often disappear in breakout rooms, our whiteboard retains its full power. Students can work together on documents, solve problems, and brainstorm on their own collaborative canvas in each breakout room, just as they would in the main session.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: The Best Tool is the One You Don\'t Notice\\n\\nOur philosophy is simple: your teaching tools shouldn\'t get in your way. They should feel so natural and integrated that you don\'t even think about them.\\n\\nBy building our whiteboard as a core, native feature, we\'ve created a fast, powerful, and seamless collaborative space that truly belongs in your classroom.

You sign up for a service like Zoom or Google Meet, pay a monthly fee, and use it for your internal meetings. You are, in effect, **renting** your video solution. And for many use cases, that\'s perfectly fine.\\n\\nBut what happens when video is more than just a utility? What happens when it\'s a core part of your **product**, your **customer experience**, or your **brand identity**?\\n\\nSuddenly, renting becomes a strategic liability. You\'re building a critical part of your business on a platform you don\'t control, using an interface that looks just like your competitors\', and sending your valuable user data to a third party.\\n\\nThis is why smart businesses are moving from renting their video solution to **owning it**. By leveraging powerful, self-hosted platforms like **plugNmeet**, they are transforming video from a simple utility into a strategic asset and a powerful competitive advantage.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Hidden Costs of \\"Renting\\" Your Video Platform\\n\\nUsing a public SaaS video provider for a customer-facing product seems easy at first, but it comes with significant hidden costs.\\n\\n### 1. You Have No Brand Differentiation\\nWhen you send a customer to a standard Zoom meeting, you are reinforcing Zoom\'s brand, not your own. The user experience is generic and identical to the one your competitors are using. You have no ability to create a unique, memorable interaction that feels like a seamless part of your product.\\n\\n### 2. Your Data Becomes Their Asset\\nEvery time your users interact with the video service, they are generating valuable data: who is talking to whom, for how long, what features are they using? When you use a third-party platform, you are handing all of these valuable insights over to them. You lose the ability to analyze this data to improve your own product.\\n\\n### 3. You Are Trapped in a \\"Black Box\\"\\nIntegration with a public SaaS platform is often limited to a superficial API. You can create users and schedule meetings, but you can\'t deeply change the user experience. You\'re forced to embed their client in a restrictive `<iframe>`, and you have no control over the layout, the workflow, or the underlying features.\\n\\n### 4. Your Costs Are Unpredictable and Escalate\\nPer-user, per-month, or per-minute pricing models are manageable at a small scale, but they become incredibly expensive as your business grows. Your success is penalized with escalating costs, and you have no control over future price increases.\\n\\n## The Power of \\"Owning\\" Your Video Platform\\n\\nBy self-hosting a platform like plugNmeet, you flip the script. You move from being a tenant to being the owner.\\n\\n### 1. Video Becomes a Native Feature, Not a Link\\nInstead of sending users to an external link, the video experience happens directly within your own application. It feels like a native, integrated feature, creating a seamless and professional user journey that you control from start to finish.\\n\\n### 2. You Own the Brand Experience\\nWith deep customization capabilities, you can style every aspect of the video client to perfectly match your brand\'s look and feel. The colors, the fonts, the layout\u2014it all becomes *your* experience, reinforcing your brand and building user trust.\\n\\n### 3. You Own Your Data and Insights\\nBecause the entire platform runs on your own servers, all data and analytics are yours. You can analyze usage patterns, understand user behavior, and gain valuable insights to build a better product, all without ever compromising your users\' privacy.\\n\\n### 4. Your Costs Are Predictable and Transparent\\nWith a self-hosted solution, your cost is the server infrastructure it runs on. This cost is predictable and does not scale with the number of users you have. You can grow your business without worrying about runaway licensing fees.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: Is Video a Utility or a Strategic Asset?\\n\\nThe choice is simple. If video is just a tool for internal team meetings, renting is a perfectly valid strategy.\\n\\nBut if video is a core part of how you serve your customers, deliver your product, or express your brand, then **owning the platform is the only viable long-term strategy.**\\n\\nOwning your video stack allows you to build a defensible, unique, and cost-effective competitive advantage. Platforms like plugNmeet provide the open-source foundation to make this ownership a reality, giving you the power of a production-ready video platform without sacrificing control.\\n\\n---\\n**Ready to take ownership of your video strategy?**\\n\\n*   **Explore our [Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**\\n*   **Check out our [Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**\\n*   **Read our [API Documentation](/docs/api/intro)**"},{"id":"no-installation-browser-first-philosophy","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/no-installation-browser-first-philosophy","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-22-no-installation-browser-first-philosophy.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-22-no-installation-browser-first-philosophy.md","title":"Click a Link, Join a Meeting: The \\"No Installation\\" Philosophy","description":"Think about the last time a new application asked you to \\"download and install\\" something.

A small wave of hesitation probably washed over you. Is this software safe? Will it slow down my computer? Do I have time for this? It\'s a moment of friction and uncertainty.\\n\\nAt plugNmeet, we believe that joining a video meeting should be as simple and frictionless as visiting a website. That\'s why we\'ve built our entire platform around a core philosophy: **No installation required.**\\n\\nThis isn\'t just a convenience; it\'s a deliberate design choice that leads to a more secure, more private, and fundamentally better user experience for everyone.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Power of the Modern Web Browser\\n\\nYour web browser\u2014whether it\'s Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari\u2014is an incredibly powerful piece of software. Think of it as a secure \\"Swiss Army knife\\" for the internet, equipped with advanced tools for communication, security, and storage.\\n\\nInstead of asking you to download a separate, standalone application, we decided to leverage the powerful tools that are **already built into your browser.** This approach has three huge benefits.\\n\\n### 1. Unmatched Simplicity and Accessibility\\n\\nThis is the most obvious benefit. With plugNmeet, you join a meeting by clicking a link. That\'s it.\\n\\n*   **No Downloads, No Delays:** You never have to download an `.exe` or `.dmg` file. You\'re in the meeting in seconds.\\n*   **Always Up-to-Date:** You are always using the latest, most secure version of the software without ever having to click an \\"update\\" button.\\n*   **It Just Works, Everywhere:** If you have a modern web browser, you can use plugNmeet. It works on almost any computer without worrying about compatibility issues.\\n\\n### 2. Gold-Standard Security, Built-In\\n\\nYou might think a standalone app is more secure, but often the opposite is true. Modern browsers have world-class security teams behind them and come with powerful, built-in encryption tools.\\n\\nWe use these tools to offer **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**.\\n\\nIn simple terms, E2EE scrambles your video and audio the moment it leaves your computer and only unscrambles it when it reaches the other participants. Not even our server can see or hear the content of your conversation.\\n\\nBy using the browser\'s native encryption capabilities, we can provide this \\"gold-standard\\" security without requiring you to install any extra security software. The protection is already there, and we simply turn it on.\\n\\n### 3. A Smarter, More Private Experience\\n\\nYour browser also has a small, private storage space that belongs only to you. We use this to temporarily remember your in-meeting activity.\\n\\nAs we explained in a previous post, this is how we can restore your chat history and whiteboard drawings if you accidentally refresh the page.\\n\\nThis data lives **only on your computer** and is deleted when you properly leave the meeting. By using your browser\'s own storage, we don\'t have to save this sensitive session data on our servers. It\'s a simple way we deliver a better experience while fiercely protecting your privacy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: The Best Technology is Invisible\\n\\nOur \\"no installation\\" philosophy is about more than just convenience. It\'s about respecting your time, your security, and your privacy.\\n\\nBy building on the powerful, secure foundation of the modern web browser, we can deliver a seamless experience that just works. We believe the best technology is the kind you don\'t even have to think about. You click a link, and you\'re there. It\'s that simple.\\n\\n---\\n**Ready to experience the difference?**\\n\\n*   **Try our [Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html) right now in your browser**\\n*   **Read our complete [Security Overview](/docs/security-overview)**\\n*   **Explore our [Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**"},{"id":"classroom-analytics-for-educators","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/classroom-analytics-for-educators","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-19-classroom-analytics-for-educators.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-19-classroom-analytics-for-educators.md","title":"From Black Box to Blueprint: Using Analytics to Understand Your Online Classroom","description":"For many educators, the online classroom can feel like a black box.

Did the quiet student understand the concept, or were they just disengaged? Which parts of the lesson sparked the most discussion? Was a student\'s abrupt departure a technical issue or did they simply leave?\\n\\nIn a physical classroom, a teacher can read the room. Online, they are often flying blind.\\n\\nAt plugNmeet, we believe that data, when used ethically and transparently, can provide the insights needed to transform this black box into a blueprint for better teaching. Our built-in analytics feature is designed not as a surveillance tool, but as a source of raw material to help you evaluate and improve your virtual classroom performance. And we\'ve built it with a \\"privacy-by-default\\" philosophy.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## A Privacy-First Foundation\\n\\nBefore we dive into the \\"what,\\" let\'s talk about the \\"how.\\" In education, data privacy is paramount. That\'s why our analytics feature is built on two core principles:\\n\\n1.  **It is Always Opt-In:** Analytics are **disabled by default**. The feature must be actively enabled by an administrator on a per-room basis using the `enable_analytics` flag. If you do nothing, no data is ever saved.\\n2.  **Data is Discarded by Default:** If analytics are disabled for a session, all the in-memory data collected during the meeting is **immediately and permanently discarded** the moment the session ends. It is never written to a file or a database.\\n\\nWhen you *do* choose to enable analytics, the data is saved as a simple JSON file on your own server, and you can access it via our Analytics API. You remain in full control.\\n\\n## Turning Data into Educational Insights\\n\\nSo, what can you learn from this raw material? The goal is to answer real pedagogical questions.\\n\\n### Insight 1: Who is Engaging and How?\\n\\nInstead of just seeing a list of attendees, you can understand the texture of participation.\\n\\n*   **Questions You Can Answer:** Which students are asking questions? Who is participating in polls? Who is actively using the whiteboard?\\n*   **The Data Points:** `raise_hand`, `voted_poll`, `public_chat`, `whiteboard_annotated`.\\n\\n### Insight 2: Are Contributions Equitable?\\n\\nIn any classroom, some students are more vocal than others. Data can help you see who might need more encouragement to speak up.\\n\\n*   **Questions You Can Answer:** Which students are speaking the most? Who has their microphone unmuted but isn\'t contributing?\\n*   **The Data Points:** `talked_duration`, `mic_muted`, `mic_status`.\\n\\n### Insight 3: Is Technology a Barrier?\\n\\nSometimes, a student\'s lack of participation isn\'t about engagement\u2014it\'s about their internet connection.\\n\\n*   **Questions You Can Answer:** Did a student who left early have a poor connection quality throughout the session?\\n*   **The Data Points:** `connection_quality`, `duration`, `left`.\\n\\n### Insight 4: How Are Your Materials Being Used?\\n\\nData can give you feedback on the resources you\'re sharing in real-time.\\n\\n*   **Questions You Can Answer:** How many files were shared in the chat? Did students interact with the documents uploaded to the whiteboard?\\n*   **The Data Points:** `chat_files`, `whiteboard_files`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: Data for Better Teaching, Not for Tracking\\n\\nThe analytics data provided by plugNmeet is not about tracking users; it\'s about understanding the dynamics of a learning environment. It provides the raw material for educators to reflect on their practice, identify students who may need support, and ultimately, create a more effective and equitable online classroom.\\n\\nBy combining these powerful insights with a privacy-first, opt-in architecture, we give you the tools to improve your teaching without compromising the trust of your students.\\n\\n---\\n**Ready to learn more?**\\n\\n*   **Explore the [Analytics API Documentation](/docs/api/analytics/fetch)**\\n*   **Read our complete [Security Overview](/docs/security-overview)**"},{"id":"embed-web-content-dynamic-collaboration","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/embed-web-content-dynamic-collaboration","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-17-embed-web-content-dynamic-collaboration.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-17-embed-web-content-dynamic-collaboration.md","title":"Bring the Web into Your Meeting: Seamlessly Embed Websites and Apps for Dynamic Collaboration","description":"How many times have you been in an online meeting where the presenter says, \\"Okay, I\'m going to share my screen now... wait, let me find the right tab... can you all see this?

Now, let me switch to this other tab...\\"?\\n\\nThis constant switching, sharing, and re-sharing breaks the flow, distracts participants, and turns what should be a dynamic collaboration into a clunky, disjointed experience. Your meeting becomes a series of disconnected windows, not a unified workspace.\\n\\nAt Plug-N-Meet, we believe your meeting room should be as versatile as your web browser. That\'s why we built the **\\"Share External Link\\"** feature, allowing you to seamlessly display any website or web application directly within your meeting, transforming it into a truly interactive and engaging environment.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Problem: The Friction of Tab-Switching\\n\\nTraditional screen sharing is great for showing a static document or a single application. But modern collaboration often involves multiple web-based tools: a project management board, a shared document, a live dashboard, or even an interactive poll.\\n\\nTrying to manage these by constantly sharing and unsharing your screen is inefficient and frustrating. It pulls participants out of the meeting context and makes it hard to maintain focus.\\n\\n### The Solution: Your Meeting, Your Web Browser\\n\\nThe \\"Share External Link\\" feature solves this by turning your meeting\'s main stage into a dynamic web viewer. A moderator can simply paste a URL, and that website or web application instantly appears for all participants, right within the Plug-N-Meet interface.\\n\\n**How it Works (Simple Steps):**\\n\\n1.  As a moderator, click the \\"More Options\\" menu (...) in the control bar.\\n2.  Select **\\"Share External Link.\\"**\\n3.  Paste the URL of the website or web application you wish to share.\\n4.  The content will immediately load and be visible to everyone in the meeting.\\n\\n*(Note: For security reasons, the external website must allow itself to be embedded in an iframe. Most modern web applications are configured this way.)*\\n\\n### Powerful Use Cases: Transform Your Meetings\\n\\nThis simple feature unlocks a world of possibilities for more dynamic and productive meetings:\\n\\n*   **Collaborative Document Editing:** Work on a Google Doc, Notion page, or a shared project management board (like Trello or Asana) together in real-time. Everyone sees the same content, and the moderator can even allow participants to interact with it directly.\\n*   **Interactive Presentations & Training:** Embed a live poll, a quiz from a learning platform, or an interactive data visualization directly into your presentation flow. No need to send participants to a separate link; everything happens within the meeting.\\n*   **Design & Code Reviews:** Display a live Figma or Miro board for real-time feedback, or review a code repository together, making annotations and discussions seamless.\\n*   **Onboarding & Support:** Walk new hires through an online HR portal, a software demo, or a customer support ticket system directly within the meeting, ensuring everyone is on the same page.\\n*   **Virtual Tours & Interactive Content:** Share a collaborative online game, or a virtual tour to make your meetings more engaging and interactive.\\n\\n### Moderator Control, Seamless Experience\\n\\nThe moderator retains full control over what web content is displayed and when, ensuring the meeting stays focused. Participants remain within the familiar Plug-N-Meet environment, reducing distractions and improving overall engagement. It\'s about bringing the tools to the conversation, not sending the conversation to the tools.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: Your Meeting, Your Dynamic Workspace\\n\\nThe \\"Share External Link\\" feature transforms your Plug-N-Meet room from a simple video call into a versatile, dynamic workspace. It allows you to integrate the vast resources of the web directly into your collaboration, making your presentations more engaging, your discussions more productive, and your overall meeting experience far more seamless.\\n\\nStop switching tabs.

It\u2019s a fantastic way to get started, but to build a truly professional and seamless product, you need to go deeper.\\n\\nAn `<iframe>` is a box. It isolates the meeting client from your main application, creating a visible separation that can feel clunky and limit your branding potential.\\n\\nThis guide is the next step in your developer journey. We will show you how to break out of the box and create a deeply integrated, fully white-labeled video conferencing experience using Plug-N-Meet\'s powerful \\"headless\\" integration and design customization APIs.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 1: Eliminate the Iframe with the `getClientFiles` API\\n\\nThe key to a seamless user experience is to make the video client feel like a native part of your application. The `getClientFiles` API is designed for exactly this purpose. Instead of embedding a pre-built page, this API gives you the power to render the Plug-N-Meet client directly within your own page\'s HTML structure.\\n\\n**The Workflow:**\\n\\n1.  **Your Backend Fetches the Assets:** Your server makes a call to the `/getClientFiles` endpoint.\\n2.  **The API Responds:** Plug-N-Meet returns a simple JSON object containing two arrays: one with the required CSS filenames and one with the JavaScript filenames.\\n3.  **You Dynamically Build the Page:** Your server-side code (PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.) iterates through these arrays and dynamically generates the necessary `<link>` and `<script>` tags in your HTML.\\n\\nHere is a simplified example using PHP to illustrate the logic. This approach can be easily adapted to any server-side language.\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n// Your Plug-N-Meet server details\\n$plugnmeet_server_url = \'https://plugnmeet.example.com\';\\n$api_key = \'plugnmeet\';\\n$api_secret = \'zumyyYWqv7KR2kUqvYdq4z4sXg7XTBD2ljT6\';\\n\\n// Define design options for this session\\n$designOptions = [\\n    \'primary_color\' => \'#004D90\',\\n    \'secondary_color\' => \'#24AEF7\',\\n    \'custom_logo\' => \'https://mydomain.com/logo.png\',\\n    \'custom_css_url\' => \'https://mydomain.com/my-custom-styles.css\'\\n];\\n\\n// 1. Call the getClientFiles API (using a helper function or SDK)\\n// For this example, we\'ll use a sample response.\\n$clientFilesResponse = [\\n    \'status\' => true,\\n    \'css\' => [\'styles.8f34.css\', \'vendor.9c3a.css\'],\\n    \'js\' => [\'runtime.3e4a.js\', \'vendor.b12c.js\', \'main-module.a4f1.js\'],\\n];\\n\\n$assets_path = $plugnmeet_server_url . \'/assets\';\\n\\n// This is the access token you generated for the user\\n$access_token = \'...your_generated_access_token...\';\\n?>\\n\\n<!doctype html>\\n<html lang=\\"en\\">\\n<head>\\n    <title>My Custom Video App</title>\\n\\n    \x3c!-- 2. Dynamically generate CSS <link> tags --\x3e\\n    <?php foreach ($clientFilesResponse[\'css\'] as $css_file): ?>\\n        <link href=\\"<?php echo $assets_path . \'/css/\' . $css_file; ?>\\" rel=\\"stylesheet\\" />\\n    <?php endforeach; ?>\\n\\n    \x3c!-- 3.

The client will mount itself in this div --\x3e\\n    <div id=\\"plugNmeet-app\\"></div>\\n\\n    \x3c!-- 5. Dynamically generate JS <script> tags --\x3e\\n    <?php foreach ($clientFilesResponse[\'js\'] as $js_file): ?>\\n        <?php if (str_starts_with($js_file, \'main-module.\')): ?>\\n            <script src=\\"<?php echo $assets_path . \'/js/\' . $js_file; ?>\\" type=\\"module\\"><\/script>\\n        <?php else: ?>\\n            <script src=\\"<?php echo $assets_path . \'/js/\' . $js_file; ?>\\" defer=\\"defer\\"><\/script>\\n        <?php endif; ?>\\n    <?php endforeach; ?>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\nBy following this pattern, you\'ve achieved a \\"headless\\" integration. The video conference now loads as a native component of your page, giving you complete control over the surrounding layout and user experience.\\n\\n> For a complete walkthrough, see the **[getClientFiles API Documentation](/docs/api/get-client-files)**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 2: Full Branding with Client-Side Configuration\\n\\nNow that the client is running natively on your page, it\'s time to make it look like *your* brand. Plug-N-Meet offers two powerful layers of design customization.\\n\\n### Method A: Quick Branding with `window.DESIGN_CUSTOMIZATION`\\n\\nThe most flexible way to apply branding in a headless integration is to set the `window.DESIGN_CUSTOMIZATION` variable directly in your HTML page. This gives you dynamic, per-session control over the user interface.\\n\\nAs shown in the full example in Step 1, you can define these options in a PHP array, convert it to JSON, and inject it directly into the `<head>` of your page. This allows you to dynamically change the branding for different users or tenants.\\n\\n### Method B: Total Control with Custom CSS\\n\\nFor ultimate control, the `custom_css_url` parameter is your best friend. This allows you to load your own stylesheet *after* all the default Plug-N-Meet styles, giving you the power to override any element.\\n\\nWant to change the font of the header title or the background of the participants panel? Simply find the element\'s CSS class using your browser\'s inspector and add your own rules to your custom CSS file.\\n\\n**Example `my-custom-styles.css`:**\\n```css\\n/* Change the main header background and border */\\nheader#main-header {\\n    background-color: #0A1929;\\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #004D90;\\n}\\n\\n/* Customize the header title font */\\nh2.header-title {\\n    font-family: \'Poppins\', sans-serif;\\n    color: #E1EFFF;\\n    font-weight: 600;\\n}\\n\\n/* Style the main control bar buttons */\\n.control-bar-wrapper .btn {\\n    background-color: #0E2A47;\\n    border-radius: 12px;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> For a full list of parameters and CSS examples, check out our **[Design Customization Guide](/docs/developer-guide/design-customisation)**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: You Own the Experience\\n\\nBy combining the `getClientFiles` API with robust design customization, you elevate your application from a simple integration to a professional, white-labeled platform. You are no longer just embedding a tool; you are delivering a seamless experience that reinforces your brand and gives your users confidence.\\n\\nThis is the power of an API-first platform. It provides the building blocks not just to create a feature, but to build a product that is truly your own.\\n\\n---\\n**Ready to get started?**\\n\\n*   **Follow the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation)**\\n*   **Explore the [API Documentation](/docs/api/intro)**"},{"id":"synchronized-video-playback-feature","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/synchronized-video-playback-feature","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-15-play-external-video-feature.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-15-play-external-video-feature.md","title":"Everyone on the Same Page: Synchronized Video Playback in Your Meetings","description":"You have a video you need to discuss with your team\u2014a new marketing ad, a training module, or a customer testimonial.

What do you do?\\n\\nThe usual options are frustrating. If you share your screen, you\'re often left with a choppy, low-resolution video and distorted audio. If you paste a link in the chat, everyone watches at their own pace, making it impossible to pause and say, \\"Let\'s talk about what happens at the 1:32 mark.\\"\\n\\nAt Plug-N-Meet, we believe watching a video together should be a seamless, collaborative activity. That\'s why we built the **\\"Play External Video\\"** feature\u2014a powerful tool that synchronizes video and audio playback for every participant, turning passive viewing into an active, shared experience.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Problem: The Chaos of Un-synchronized Video\\n\\nTrying to watch a video together in a typical online meeting is a recipe for frustration. The presenter is constantly asking, \\"Has everyone finished?\\" or \\"Tell me when you get to the part with the blue car.\\"\\n\\nThis disjointed approach makes it impossible to:\\n*   Analyze a specific moment together.\\n*   Ensure everyone has seen the same content before a discussion.\\n*   Create a shared emotional impact from a powerful video.\\n\\n### The Solution: A Shared, Synchronized Media Player with Centralized Control\\n\\nThe \\"Play External Video\\" feature solves this by creating a virtual, shared media player inside your Plug-N-Meet room. The moderator has full control over the playback, and their actions are instantly broadcast to every participant.\\n\\n*   When the moderator clicks **Play**, the video plays for everyone.\\n*   When they click **Pause**, the video pauses for everyone at the exact same frame.\\n*   When they **seek to a specific time** (e.g., jumping to the 2:15 mark), every participant\'s player jumps to that precise moment.\\n\\nThis centralized control ensures everyone is always on the same page, literally.\\n\\nThis feature gives you two powerful ways to share media:\\n\\n1.  **Stream from YouTube:** Simply paste a YouTube video URL, and it will begin playing for everyone in the main presentation area.\\n2.  **Upload Your Own Media:** Directly upload your own `MP4`, `WebM`, or even `MP3` audio files. This is perfect for sharing private, high-resolution content without ever having to upload it to a public platform.\\n\\n**How it Works (Simple Steps):**\\n\\n1.  As a moderator, click the \\"More Options\\" menu (...) in the control bar.\\n2.  Select **\\"Start external Media Player.\\"**\\n3.  Choose your source: paste a YouTube URL or click to upload your own file.\\n4.  The media will load, and you will have full, synchronized control over playback for the entire room.\\n\\n### Powerful Use Cases: More Than Just Watching\\n\\nThis feature opens up a new world of possibilities for training, collaboration, and engagement:\\n\\n*   **Education & Flipped Classrooms:** A teacher can play a pre-recorded lecture segment and pause it at key moments to poll the class or start a discussion, ensuring all students are on the same page.\\n*   **Marketing & Design Reviews:** A marketing team can review the final cut of a new video advertisement together, pausing frame-by-frame to discuss visual details and timing.\\n*   **Onboarding & HR Training:** An HR manager can play a standardized training video for new hires and facilitate a live Q&A session immediately afterward.\\n*   **Community Movie Nights:** Foster a sense of community by hosting a synchronized \\"movie night\\" or a listening party for a new podcast episode, creating a fun, shared social event.\\n\\n### The Power of Shared Context\\n\\nThe \\"Play External Video\\" feature is about creating a **shared context**. When everyone is looking at the same frame at the same time, you can have deeper, more meaningful discussions. The moderator becomes a conductor, guiding the audience through the content and ensuring that the key moments land with maximum impact.\\n\\nIt\'s the difference between saying \\"Go watch this video\\" and saying \\"Let\'s watch this together.\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: Transform Passive Viewing into Active Collaboration\\n\\nStop struggling with choppy screen shares and out-of-sync links. With Plug-N-Meet\'s \\"Play External Video\\" feature, you can effortlessly create a professional, engaging, and truly collaborative viewing experience.\\n\\nIt\'s one more tool that elevates your meetings from simple calls into powerful, interactive sessions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Ready to watch together?**\\n\\n*   **Try the \\"Play External Video\\" feature in our [Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**\\n*   **Explore our [Moderator Guide](/docs/user-guide/moderator) to learn more about in-meeting controls**\\n*   **Check out the [Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**"},{"id":"real-time-translation-live-captions-for-global-communication","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/real-time-translation-live-captions-for-global-communication","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-13-real-time-translation-live-captions.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-13-real-time-translation-live-captions.md","title":"Breaking Down Language Barriers: Real-Time Translation and Live Captions in Your Video Meetings","description":"In today\'s hyper-connected world, your team, your classroom, or your community isn\'t in one city; it\'s in every corner of the globe.

A project update might involve team members from Berlin, Tokyo, and S\xe3o Paulo. A university lecture could have students tuning in from a dozen different countries.\\n\\nThis creates a huge, unspoken barrier. When everyone is forced to communicate in a single language, who is being left out? Who is hesitant to speak up? Who is missing the critical details?\\n\\nAt Plug-N-Meet, we believe that technology should break down these barriers, not create new ones. That\'s why we built a powerful, integrated **Live Captions and Real-Time Translation** feature. It\u2019s a tool designed to transform your video meetings from a one-language monologue into a truly global, multilingual conversation.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Foundation: Live Captions for Clarity and Accessibility\\n\\nThe first layer of our solution is real-time speech-to-text. When a participant speaks, our system can instantly transcribe their words and display them as live captions at the bottom of the screen.\\n\\nThis is more than just a convenience; it\'s a fundamental boost to communication for everyone:\\n\\n*   **For Accessibility:** It provides an essential service for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing, ensuring they can fully engage in the conversation.\\n*   **For Clarity:** In a noisy environment or when trying to understand a speaker with a strong accent, captions provide a written backup that ensures no detail is missed.\\n*   **For Focus:** For visual learners, seeing the words can significantly improve comprehension and retention.\\n\\n### The Magic: Instant, User-Controlled Translation\\n\\nHere is where we take a huge leap forward. Seeing the captions is powerful, but what if you could see them *in your own native language*?\\n\\nWith Plug-N-Meet, every single user has the power to do just that.\\n\\nFrom a simple dropdown menu within the meeting, a participant can select their preferred language. The live captions they see will then be instantly and automatically translated.\\n\\nThe experience is seamless and personal:\\n*   A team member in Germany can choose to see German translations.\\n*   A student in Japan can simultaneously see Japanese translations.\\n*   The main speaker in the United States doesn\'t have to do anything different.\\n\\nEveryone in the meeting can independently choose the language they are most comfortable with, empowering them to understand every nuance and contribute with confidence.\\n\\n### Powered by World-Class Technology\\n\\nTo deliver this high-quality, real-time transcription and translation, Plug-N-Meet integrates with **Microsoft Azure\'s Cognitive Services**. By leveraging Azure\'s powerful AI-driven speech-to-text and translation engines, we can provide a fast, accurate, and reliable experience that supports a vast number of languages.\\n\\nAs a self-hosted platform, you remain in control. You simply add your own Azure API credentials to your Plug-N-Meet server configuration, ensuring that you have a direct relationship with the service provider and full transparency into your usage.\\n\\n### Who is This For? Every Global Organization.\\n\\nThis feature isn\'t a niche add-on; it\'s a core tool for any organization that operates on a global scale. We built it for:\\n\\n*   **Global Enterprises:** Imagine a quarterly all-hands meeting where your CEO\'s message is instantly accessible to every employee in their native language. It fosters a level of inclusion and clarity that was previously impossible.\\n*   **Educators and Universities:** A professor can deliver a lecture knowing that international students can follow along with real-time translations, breaking down barriers to learning and participation.\\n*   **NGOs and Non-Profits:** When coordinating disaster relief or running global initiatives, clear communication is critical. This tool ensures that volunteers and team members from different regions are always on the same page.\\n\\n### Conclusion: More Than a Meeting, It\'s a Conversation\\n\\nTrue communication isn\'t just about transmitting information; it\'s about ensuring that information is understood. By integrating live captions and real-time translation directly into the core experience, Plug-N-Meet transforms a simple video call into a powerful platform for inclusive, global collaboration.\\n\\nIt\u2019s one more way we\u2019re working to build a future where technology connects us, no matter what language we speak.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Ready to break down your own language barriers?**\\n\\n*   **Try the Live Captions and Translation in our [Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**\\n*   **Explore our [Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**\\n*   **Read our [Introduction](/docs/intro) to see what else is possible**"},{"id":"engaging-audience-with-live-polls","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/engaging-audience-with-live-polls","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-11-engaging-audience-with-live-polls.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-11-engaging-audience-with-live-polls.md","title":"Beyond the Chat: How to Engage Your Audience and Make Decisions with Live Polls","description":"You\'re hosting a webinar and ask a critical question: \\"Does this new feature seem useful to you?\\" The response?

That\'s why we built a simple, powerful **Live Polling** feature directly into the core meeting experience. It\'s the definitive tool for transforming a passive audience into active participants and for making data-driven decisions in real-time.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Problem: The Chaos of Open-Ended Feedback\\n\\nWhen you ask a question to a large group online, you face two problems:\\n\\n1.  **Audience Hesitation:** Most people won\'t unmute themselves to answer a simple question.\\n2.  **Chat Overload:** For those who do respond, their answers are mixed in with unrelated chatter, making it impossible to get a quick, quantifiable summary.\\n\\nYou\'re left trying to manually tally responses from a scrolling window, which is both inefficient and unprofessional.\\n\\n### The Solution: Fast, Structured, and Quantifiable Feedback\\n\\nThe Live Polling feature solves this by providing a clean and simple interface for asking questions and gathering structured responses.\\n\\n**How it Works (The Moderator\'s Experience):**\\n\\n1.  From the participant panel, the host navigates to the **Polls** tab and clicks **\\"Create new Poll.\\"**\\n2.  A simple form appears. The host types their question and defines the answer options (e.g., \\"Yes/No/Maybe\\" or a multiple-choice list).\\n3.  Crucially, the host can choose to make the poll **anonymous**. This is a powerful option that encourages more honest feedback on sensitive topics.\\n4.  With a click of **\\"Create poll,\\"** the poll is instantly pushed to all participants, appearing as a clean notification on their screen.\\n5.  The host can watch the results update in real-time as the votes come in.\\n6.  Once the poll is closed, the host can click the **\\"Publish Results\\"** button. This shares a clean, graphical summary of the final vote with everyone in the meeting, providing a perfect, data-backed starting point for a deeper discussion.\\n\\n### Powerful Use Cases for Any Scenario\\n\\nLive polls are incredibly versatile. Here are just a few ways to use them:\\n\\n*   **For Educators:**\\n    *   **Quick Quizzes:** Run a quick multiple-choice quiz to check for comprehension before moving on to the next topic.\\n    *   **Classroom Decisions:** Take a quick, democratic vote on which homework problem to review first.\\n    *   **Anonymous Feedback:** Ask students if the pace of the lecture is \\"Too Fast,\\" \\"Just Right,\\" or \\"Too Slow\\" to adjust your teaching in real-time.\\n\\n*   **For Businesses & Webinars:**\\n    *   **Audience Segmentation:** Ask attendees about their role or industry to better tailor your presentation.\\n    *   **Group Decision-Making:** In a team meeting, quickly get consensus on a decision instead of having a long, drawn-out debate.\\n    *   **Instant Feedback:** After demoing a new feature, get immediate, quantifiable feedback on its appeal.\\n\\n*   **For Community Events:**\\n    *   **Icebreakers:** Start a meeting with a fun, lighthearted poll (e.g., \\"Coffee or Tea?\\").\\n    *   **Content Planning:** Let your community vote on the topic for the next monthly call.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: Listen to Your Audience\\n\\nLive polls are a simple but profound tool for any meeting host.

The internet is full of \\"free\\" tiers from major SaaS providers, and they seem like the perfect solution.\\n\\nBut what is the true cost of \\"free\\"?\\n\\nToo often, the price isn\'t on the invoice; it\'s hidden in the terms of service. You pay with your data, your brand identity, and your control. This article explores the hidden costs of \\"free\\" video conferencing and introduces a better, more empowering alternative.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. The Price of Your Privacy: When You Are the Product\\n\\nThe old saying holds true: if you\'re not paying for the product, you *are* the product. \\"Free\\" SaaS platforms are businesses, and they have to make money. Often, this is done by collecting, analyzing, and sometimes monetizing your data and the data of your users.\\n\\n*   **Data Mining:** Your usage patterns, meeting metadata, and even chat content can be analyzed to build profiles for advertising and marketing.\\n*   **Compliance Risks:** For businesses, schools, and healthcare providers, sending user data to a third-party cloud can create major privacy and compliance headaches (like GDPR, HIPAA, or FERPA).\\n\\nWith a self-hosted platform like Plug-N-Meet, this entire problem disappears. **You own the server, so you own your data. Period.** All information stays within your own infrastructure, giving you the ultimate level of security and control.\\n\\n### 2. The Price of Your Brand: The \\"Branding Straitjacket\\"\\n\\nA \\"free\\" meeting on a proprietary platform is a constant advertisement for *their* brand, not yours.\\n\\n*   **Their Logo, Their URL:** Your users are forced to join a meeting on `zoom.us` or `meet.google.com`, with their logos and branding front and center. It makes your organization look less professional and breaks the seamless experience of your own website.\\n*   **Crippled Features:** \\"Free\\" tiers are designed to be frustrating. They impose strict time limits (like the infamous 40-minute meeting), limit the number of participants, and lock away powerful features like recording or customization, all in an effort to push you to their expensive paid plans.\\n\\nWith Plug-N-Meet, you are free from the branding straitjacket. Because it\'s your platform, you have **full control over the user experience**. You can add your own logo, use your own domain, and, most importantly, you get access to **all the features**\u2014unlimited meeting duration, powerful collaboration tools, and API-driven customization\u2014from day one.\\n\\n### 3. The Price of Your Freedom: Building on Rented Land\\n\\nWhen you build your business or community on a \\"free\\" SaaS platform, you are building on rented land. The landlord can change the rules, raise the rent, or even evict you at any time.\\n\\nYou are completely dependent on their roadmap, their pricing changes, and their business decisions. If they decide to remove a feature you rely on, you have no recourse.\\n\\nWith an open-source solution like Plug-N-Meet, you are building on a foundation that you own. The code is yours to inspect, modify, and use as you see fit. You are in control of your own destiny, free from the whims of a third-party provider.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: Choose a Better Kind of Free\\n\\nThe search for \\"free video conferencing\\" shouldn\'t end with a compromise. It should end with empowerment.\\n\\nWhile Plug-N-Meet requires a server to run, this translates to a small, predictable cost that *you* control, rather than a per-user fee that scales unpredictably. In return, you get a better kind of free:\\n\\n*   **Free from Data Exploitation.**\\n*   **Free from Branding Limitations.**\\n*   **Free from Corporate Control.**\\n\\nDon\'t settle for a \\"free\\" service that treats you like the product. Choose a platform that treats you like the owner.\\n\\n---\\n**Ready to experience true freedom?**\\n\\n*   **Explore our [Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**\\n*   **Try our [Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html) to see all the features, for free**\\n*   **Read our [Installation Guide](/docs/intro) to start building your own platform**"},{"id":"mastering-breakout-rooms","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mastering-breakout-rooms","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-09-mastering-breakout-rooms.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-09-mastering-breakout-rooms.md","title":"From Lecture to Collaboration: A Deep Dive into Mastering Breakout Rooms","description":"We\u2019ve all been in a large online meeting where the presenter asks, \\"Any questions or ideas?\\" and is met with a wall of silent, black squares.

In a big group, people are often hesitant to speak up, and true brainstorming is nearly impossible. The meeting becomes a one-way lecture, not a two-way collaboration.\\n\\nHow do you spark real discussion and teamwork when you have dozens of people in one virtual space? You break it down.\\n\\nAt Plug-N-Meet, we\'ve built a powerful and intuitive **Breakout Rooms** feature that allows you to seamlessly split a large meeting into smaller, focused groups. It\'s the ultimate tool for transforming a passive audience into active, engaged participants.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Problem: The Silence of the Large Group\\n\\nIn a large online session, genuine interaction dies. It\u2019s hard to have a natural conversation, side discussions are impossible, and many participants feel too intimidated to contribute. This is a major barrier for:\\n\\n*   **Educators** who want to use active learning techniques like \\"think-pair-share.\\"\\n*   **Corporate Trainers** who need to facilitate small group exercises.\\n*   **Event Organizers** who want to create networking opportunities.\\n\\n### The Solution: Small Groups, Big Ideas\\n\\nThe Breakout Rooms feature allows a moderator to instantly create multiple, separate, and fully private sub-meetings within the main session.\\n\\n**How it Works (The Moderator\'s View):**\\n\\n1.  From the \\"More Options\\" menu, the host selects **\\"Manage breakout room.\\"**\\n2.  **Configure the Session:** The host chooses the number of rooms to create and sets a timer (e.g., \\"15 minutes\\").\\n3.  **Assign Participants:** The host has two easy options:\\n    *   **Randomly Assign:** With one click, Plug-N-Meet automatically and evenly distributes participants across the rooms.\\n    *   **Manually Assign:** For pre-planned groups, the host can simply drag and drop participants into their designated rooms.\\n4.  **Launch the Rooms:** The host clicks \\"Start,\\" and participants are whisked away to their private group space.\\n\\nWhile the breakout sessions are active, the moderator has \\"superpowers.\\" They can **broadcast a message** to all rooms simultaneously (like \\"5 minutes remaining!\\") or **join specific rooms** to check on progress and answer questions. When the timer expires, all participants are automatically brought back to the main room.\\n\\n### The Real Magic: Fully-Featured Collaboration in Every Room\\n\\nHere is what makes the Plug-N-Meet breakout room experience truly special. Unlike other platforms where advanced tools are often disabled in sub-rooms, every single breakout room in Plug-N-Meet is a **fully functional meeting space.**\\n\\nThis means each small group gets its own:\\n*   **Private Interactive Whiteboard:** Groups can brainstorm ideas, draw diagrams, or work on problems together on their own collaborative canvas.\\n*   **Private Shared Notepad:** They can take collective notes, draft text, or list ideas without cluttering the main session\'s chat.\\n*   **Full Audio, Video, and Screen Sharing:** All the core features of a standard meeting are available.\\n\\nThis ensures that breakout sessions are not just talk, but true, productive work sessions.\\n\\n### Powerful Use Cases:\\n\\n*   **Education:** Facilitate group projects, peer review sessions, and problem-solving activities.\\n*   **Corporate Workshops:** Run interactive training exercises where teams can collaborate on a solution and present it back to the main group.\\n*   **\\"Unconferences\\" & Events:** Create themed \\"tables\\" and allow attendees to join rooms based on topics they want to discuss, fostering organic networking.\\n*   **Team Building:** Use the random assignment feature for fun, small-group icebreakers to help large teams connect on a more personal level.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: Turn Your Audience into a Team\\n\\nBreakout Rooms are more than just a feature; they are a fundamental shift in how online meetings are run. They empower you to move beyond the static lecture and create a truly dynamic, participatory, and collaborative environment.\\n\\nStop talking *at* your audience. Start working *with* them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Ready to foster real collaboration?**\\n\\n*   **Try the Breakout Rooms feature in our [Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**\\n*   **Read our [Moderator Guide](/docs/user-guide/moderator) for more tips**\\n*   **Explore the [Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**"},{"id":"no-code-video-conferencing-moodle","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/no-code-video-conferencing-moodle","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-09-no-code-video-conferencing-moodle.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-09-no-code-video-conferencing-moodle.md","title":"How to Add No-Code Video Conferencing to Your Moodle Courses","description":"As an educator using Moodle, your goal is to create engaging and effective learning experiences.

You want to add live, interactive video classes to your courses, but the options can be frustrating. You\'re either stuck with complex tools that require technical help, or you\'re forced to send your students to an external platform like Zoom, breaking the seamless flow of your course.\\n\\nWhat if you could add a powerful, interactive virtual classroom directly to your Moodle course as easily as adding a quiz or a forum?\\n\\nWith the official Plug-N-Meet plugin for Moodle, you can. You don\'t need to be a developer, and you don\'t need to write a single line of code. This article will show you how to create a fully integrated, no-code video conferencing service right inside your Moodle site.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Problem: The \\"Zoom Detour\\" in Your Lesson Plan\\n\\nEvery time you link to an external video tool, you create a detour in the learning journey. Students have to leave your Moodle site, deal with a different interface, and sometimes even a separate login. It\'s a clunky experience that can lead to distraction and technical support headaches.\\n\\nFurthermore, you lose control over your brand and, more importantly, your students\' data.\\n\\n### The Solution: A Native Moodle Activity\\n\\nThe Plug-N-Meet plugin transforms live video conferencing from an external link into a native Moodle activity. For your students, joining your live class is as simple and intuitive as any other part of their coursework.\\n\\nWith just a few clicks\u2014and absolutely no code\u2014you can:\\n\\n#### 1. Add a Virtual Classroom to Any Course\\n\\nFrom the \\"Add an activity or resource\\" menu in your Moodle course, you can now select \\"PlugNmeet.\\" You can give your live session a name, set a welcome message, and define the schedule, just like any other Moodle activity. It feels completely native because it *is*.\\n\\n#### 2. Control the Student Experience\\nYou are the teacher, and you control your classroom. From the simple activity settings page, you can decide:\\n*   Should students have to wait for a moderator to join?\\n*   Should the session be recorded automatically?\\n*   Who can join and with what permissions?\\n\\nThis allows you to create a safe and structured learning environment for every class.\\n\\n#### 3. Use Powerful Tools Built for Teaching\\nThis isn\'t just a simple video call. You get a full suite of interactive tools designed to make your online classes more engaging and effective:\\n*   **Interactive Whiteboard:** Upload your slides and annotate them in real-time.\\n*   **Live Polls:** Quickly check for student understanding with on-the-fly quizzes.\\n*   **Breakout Rooms:** Divide your students into small groups for collaborative projects.\\n*   **MP4 Recordings:** All recordings are automatically saved to your server and can be made available within the Moodle course for students who missed the live session.\\n\\n#### 4. Own Your School\'s Brand and Data\\nBecause Plug-N-Meet is self-hosted, the entire experience happens on your own Moodle site, under your own domain. Your school\'s logo and branding are front and center. Most importantly, all student data and recordings are stored on your own server, giving you full control and ensuring you can meet your institution\'s privacy requirements.\\n\\nFor your IT department, this self-hosted model provides a **[secure and scalable e-learning platform](/blog/secure-scalable-moodle-e-learning-platform)** that they can manage and grow with confidence.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: Your Moodle Site, Your Virtual Classroom\\n\\nStop sending your students away to third-party platforms. With the Plug-N-Meet plugin, you can build a powerful, seamless, and secure virtual classroom experience right inside the Moodle environment your students already know and trust.\\n\\nIt\'s the power of a world-class video conferencing solution, with the simplicity of a native Moodle activity.

Or, just as you\'re about to share your screen, an attendee accidentally shares their own, derailing the entire presentation.\\n\\nA successful meeting isn\'t just about good content; it\'s about good management. The difference between a chaotic, unprofessional session and a smooth, engaging one often comes down to a single question: **who is in control?**\\n\\nAt Plug-N-Meet, we believe the host should always have the power to direct the flow of their meeting. That\'s why we built a simple but incredibly powerful **Room Lock Settings** panel. Think of it as your command center, allowing you to instantly transform the dynamic of your room to fit any situation.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Your Command Center: The Room Lock Settings\\n\\nAccessible from the \\"More Options\\" menu, the Room Lock Settings panel gives you granular control over what your attendees can and cannot do. It\u2019s not about being restrictive; it\u2019s about creating the right environment for each phase of your meeting.\\n\\nLet\'s break down each tool in your command center.\\n\\n#### 1. Lock Microphone\\n\\n*   **What it does:** Instantly mutes all attendees and prevents them from unmuting themselves.\\n*   **When to use it:** This is your most essential tool. Use it for:\\n    *   **Lectures & Webinars:** Ensure the focus remains on the speaker without any background noise.\\n    *   **Panel Discussions:** Keep the audience quiet while the designated panelists are speaking.\\n    *   **Resolving Interruptions:** Instantly silence unexpected noise without having to find the source.\\n\\n#### 2. Lock Webcam\\n\\n*   **What it does:** Prevents attendees from sharing their webcams.\\n*   **When to use it:**\\n    *   **Saving Bandwidth:** In very large meetings or for users with poor internet, disabling dozens of video streams can significantly improve the call quality for everyone.\\n    *   **Focusing Attention:** In a formal presentation, locking webcams ensures all eyes are on the speaker\'s video feed.\\n\\n#### 3. Lock Screen Sharing\\n\\n*   **What it does:** Prevents attendees from sharing their screens.\\n*   **When to use it:** This is a simple but crucial tool to prevent accidental or disruptive takeovers of the main presentation area. Keep it locked until you specifically ask someone to share.\\n\\n#### 4. Lock Chat & Private Chat\\n\\n*   **What it does:** Temporarily disables the ability for attendees to send messages in the public chat or to each other privately.\\n*   **When to use it:**\\n    *   **Minimizing Distractions:** During a critical part of your presentation, you can pause the chat to ensure everyone is listening, not typing.\\n    *   **Structured Q&A:** Lock the chat during the presentation, then unlock it at the end to create a dedicated time for questions, preventing them from getting lost.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Power of Flexibility: A Meeting in Three Acts\\n\\nThe real power of these settings is not just turning them on, but using them dynamically to guide your meeting through different phases.\\n\\n*   **Act 1: The Open Welcome (5 mins before start)**\\n    *   **Settings:** Everything is unlocked.\\n    *   **Goal:** As attendees join, they can freely chat, turn on their webcams, and network. This creates a friendly, welcoming atmosphere.\\n\\n*   **Act 2: The Presentation (30 mins)**\\n    *   **Settings:** The host locks microphones, webcams, and screen sharing.\\n    *   **Goal:** The presenter has the floor. There are no interruptions. The audience can focus completely on the content being delivered.\\n\\n*   **Act 3: The Moderated Q&A (15 mins)**\\n    *   **Settings:** The host unlocks the \\"Raise Hand\\" feature and the chat.\\n    *   **Goal:** The host can now see who has a question and can unmute individuals one by one to speak. The chat is open for typed questions. The session is interactive but remains orderly and controlled.\\n\\n### Conclusion: Your Meeting, Your Rules\\n\\nWith Plug-N-Meet\'s lock settings, you are no longer just a participant in your own meeting; you are the director. You have the simple, intuitive tools to guide your audience from open collaboration to focused listening and back again, all within a single, seamless interface.\\n\\nStop letting your meetings descend into chaos.

Using off-the-shelf video conferencing tools can create a compliance nightmare. How do you ensure patient data is secure? How do you sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with a public cloud vendor whose data practices are a black box? How do you create a seamless, trusted experience for your patients?\\n\\nThe answer is to **own your stack**.\\n\\nBuilding a telehealth platform requires a foundation of absolute control over your data and infrastructure. This is why forward-thinking healthcare companies are turning to self-hosted, open-source platforms like **plugNmeet** to serve as the secure communication core for their applications. This article explains how.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Core Challenge: HIPAA and Data Sovereignty\\n\\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that Protected Health Information (PHI) be handled with strict security and privacy controls. When you use a third-party video platform, you are entrusting them with PHI, and the compliance challenges are enormous:\\n\\n1.  **Data at Rest:** Where are your call recordings and chat logs stored? Are they on a server in a specific jurisdiction? Are they encrypted? With a public cloud vendor, you often don\'t know.\\n2.  **Data in Transit:** While most services offer encryption, you have to trust their implementation and their infrastructure.\\n3.  **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs):** You need a BAA with every vendor that handles PHI. Negotiating these with large tech companies can be difficult and expensive.\\n\\n### The plugNmeet Solution: Self-Hosting is the Ultimate Control\\n\\nBy self-hosting plugNmeet on your own servers (or your own private cloud), you elegantly solve these problems:\\n\\n*   **You Control Data Sovereignty:** You decide exactly where your data lives. You can deploy your servers in the specific country or region required to meet data residency laws.\\n*   **You Control the Data:** Since all data\u2014from recordings to analytics\u2014is stored on your own infrastructure as simple files, you have complete control over its lifecycle and encryption at rest.\\n*   **You Don\'t Need a BAA with Us:** Because we are an open-source software provider and never have access to your servers or your data, there is no need for a BAA. You are the sole custodian of your patients\' PHI.\\n\\n## Creating a Seamless and Trusted Patient Experience\\n\\nA telehealth appointment should feel like a natural extension of the clinic\'s brand, not a clunky redirect to a third-party app with a different logo and UI. This is where plugNmeet\'s deep white-labeling capabilities are essential.\\n\\n*   **A Branded Environment:** Using our customization features, you can style the video client to perfectly match your application\'s branding, creating a seamless and professional experience that builds patient trust.\\n*   **No `<iframe>` Restrictions:** With our `getClientFiles` API, you can embed the video client natively into your patient portal. This allows you to build a custom layout where the video appears alongside patient charts, notes, or other critical information, creating a true \\"single pane of glass\\" for the physician.\\n\\n## Integrating with Your Healthcare Workflow\\n\\nA telehealth call is just one part of a larger workflow that includes scheduling, billing, and electronic health records (EHR). plugNmeet\'s API-first design makes it easy to integrate into these systems.\\n\\n*   **Automated Scheduling:** When an appointment is booked in your scheduling system, you can use our API to automatically pre-create a secure, unique meeting room for that specific session.\\n*   **Secure Access:** Use our `getJoinToken` API to generate a single-use token that grants the patient and doctor access only to their specific room for the duration of their appointment.\\n*   **Post-Call Automation:** Use our webhooks to trigger post-call workflows, such as automatically moving a call recording to a secure archival server or updating the patient\'s EHR with the call duration.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: The Foundation for Modern Telehealth\\n\\nBuilding a compliant and user-friendly telehealth platform doesn\'t have to mean starting from scratch or accepting the risks of public cloud services.\\n\\nBy using plugNmeet as your open-source core, you get the best of both worlds: the power of a production-ready WebRTC platform and the absolute control of a self-hosted solution. It provides the secure, compliant, and customizable foundation you need to build the future of healthcare.\\n\\n---\\n**Ready to build your telehealth platform?**\\n\\n*   **Read our complete [Security and Privacy Overview](/docs/security-overview)**\\n*   **Explore our [E2EE Key Models Guide](/blog/e2ee-key-models-guide)**\\n*   **Check out our [API Documentation](/docs/api/intro)**"},{"id":"true-white-label-video-conferencing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/true-white-label-video-conferencing","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-02-true-white-label-video-conferencing.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-02-true-white-label-video-conferencing.md","title":"Beyond the Logo: What True White-Label Video Conferencing Looks Like","description":"The term \\"white-label\\" is used a lot in the software world.

It\u2019s like putting your own sign on a franchise restaurant\u2014it might have your name on the door, but it\'s still their kitchen and their menu.\\n\\nAt plugNmeet, we believe true white-labeling is not about hiding our brand; it\'s about **empowering you to build your own.**\\n\\nOur platform is designed not as a finished product to be re-skinned, but as a flexible canvas for you to create a deeply integrated, pixel-perfect communication experience that feels like a native part of your application. This article explores the three levels of customization that make this possible.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Level 1: The Quick Rebrand (The Configuration Object)\\n\\nThis is the baseline for any white-label solution, and we make it incredibly easy. Using a simple JavaScript configuration object, you can instantly change the most important visual elements to match your brand\'s identity.\\n\\nWithin minutes, you can customize:\\n*   **Colors:** Set the primary, secondary, and background colors.\\n*   **Logos:** Add your own logo and favicon.\\n*   **Backgrounds:** Use a custom background image for your meeting rooms.\\n\\nThis is perfect for getting a branded look and feel up and running quickly, but it\'s just the beginning.\\n\\n## Level 2: API-Driven Feature Control\\n\\nTrue white-labeling goes beyond just looks; it\'s about controlling the **functionality** of the room to match your specific use case. A simple one-to-one video call has very different needs than a full-featured virtual classroom.\\n\\nPlug-N-Meet is fully controlled by our powerful server-side API. When you create a room, you are not just setting a title; you are defining the entire feature set available to the participants. This allows you to programmatically design the perfect experience, all without ever touching the client-side code.\\n\\nFor example, you can:\\n*   **Create a Minimalist Video Call:** Disable the whiteboard, shared notepad, and all other collaboration tools to create a clean, simple interface for one-to-one conversations.\\n*   **Design a Virtual Classroom:** Enable the whiteboard, polls, and breakout rooms, while disabling features like screen sharing for students.\\n*   **Host a Webinar:** Give all power to the moderator and disable chat and microphone access for attendees by default.\\n\\nThis API-driven approach means you can use the exact same client to power wildly different products and experiences, all controlled from your backend.\\n\\n## Level 3: Deep Styling (The Custom CSS URL)\\n\\nFor deeper customization beyond basic colors, Plug-N-Meet allows you to provide a URL to your own custom CSS file. This gives you pixel-perfect control to override any element and match your application\'s unique design, from fonts and button styles to the overall layout, ensuring a completely seamless look and feel.\\n\\n## Level 4: True Native Integration (The `getClientFiles` API)\\n\\nThis is the ultimate level of customization. Most web-based video tools force you to embed their client in an `<iframe>`, creating a restrictive black box with complex permission issues and a disconnected feel.\\n\\nWe do the opposite. Our `getClientFiles` API allows you to inject the client directly into your own application. The result is a video conferencing experience that feels just like another page in your app, seamlessly integrated and free from the headaches of iframe sandboxing.\\n\\nThis approach transforms plugNmeet from an \\"embedded tool\\" into a true **headless UI component library** for building real-time communication.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: Your Platform, Not Ours\\n\\nTrue white-labeling isn\'t about putting your logo on our product. It\'s about giving you the building blocks to create your own.\\n\\nWhether you need a quick rebrand, deep styling, or a fully integrated native experience, plugNmeet provides the tools to meet you where you are. Our goal is to give you the power to create a communication experience that is indistinguishable from the rest of your platform, because we believe the best video tool is the one your users don\'t even realize is there.\\n\\n---\\n**Ready to start building your custom experience?**\\n\\n*   **Read our [Design Customization Guide](/docs/developer-guide/design-customisation)**\\n*   **Explore the [`getClientFiles` API Documentation](/docs/api/get-client-files)**\\n*   **Check out the [Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html) to see it in action**"},{"id":"hosting-large-scale-events-the-smart-way","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hosting-large-scale-events-the-smart-way","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-11-01-hosting-large-scale-events.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-01-hosting-large-scale-events.md","title":"Hosting a 1000-Person Event?

The first instinct is to find a tool that can cram everyone into one giant virtual room.\\n\\nBut let me be honest: from years of experience in this industry, that approach is a technical and financial nightmare. It\'s a recipe for chaos, spiraling infrastructure costs, and a poor user experience.\\n\\nThe good news? There\'s a much smarter, more professional, and incredibly cost-effective way to do it. And you can do it with Plug-N-Meet.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Problem with the \\"One Giant Room\\" Model\\n\\nImagine trying to manage a live stage with 1,000 audience members all having a hot mic. That\'s what a 1000-person interactive video call is.\\n\\n*   **Spiraling Costs:** The server infrastructure required to handle thousands of individual, real-time video and audio streams is astronomically expensive.\\n*   **A Recipe for Chaos:** Moderating a room of that size is impossible. Accidental un-mutes, background noise, and chat overload make for a terrible audience experience.\\n*   **The Performance Bottleneck:** Even with a powerful server, the sheer number of connections creates a massive performance bottleneck, leading to lag, freezes, and a degraded experience for everyone.\\n\\nThe giants of the industry don\'t do it this way. They use a hybrid model. And now, so can you.\\n\\n### The Technical Challenge of a Single Massive Room\\n\\nTo understand the technical challenge of a single massive room, it\u2019s important to look at the components. The `plugnmeet-server` itself is a lightweight orchestrator, and NATS is designed for massive-scale messaging; both can scale horizontally with ease. The bottleneck for a *single room* lies specifically with the media server layer.\\n\\nThe **open-source version of LiveKit**, while excellent for scaling to many different rooms, is designed to run any single room\'s session on a single media server node. This means that even a very powerful machine will eventually hit a ceiling on the number of interactive participants *in that one room*.\\n\\nOvercoming this specific limitation requires a more complex architecture capable of intelligently bridging a single session across multiple media server nodes. For the vast majority of events, the Broadcast Studio Model remains the most practical and cost-effective solution. Let\'s explore how to set that up.\\n\\n### The Solution: The Broadcast Studio Model\\n\\nInstead of one giant, chaotic room, think like a television producer. You need two things: a private, controlled **Studio** for your speakers, and a massive, scalable **Audience Venue** for your viewers.\\n\\n1.  **Your Studio:** A private, high-quality Plug-N-Meet session with just your key speakers, panelists, and a moderator. This is your control room.\\n2.  **Your Venue:** A public live stream on a platform built for massive one-to-many distribution, like **YouTube**, **Facebook**, **LinkedIn**, or **Twitch**.\\n\\nWith Plug-N-Meet, you can seamlessly connect your private studio to your public venue.\\n\\n### How It Works: The Simple Steps to a Professional Event\\n\\nThis isn\'t a complex technical challenge; it\'s a simple workflow that Plug-N-Meet is perfectly designed for.\\n\\n1.  **Start Your Private Studio:** Create a standard **[Plug-N-Meet session](/blog/open-source-webinar-software-platform)**, configured with all the powerful webinar features you need. Invite your 5-10 speakers, panelists, and producers. Inside this room, you have full, high-quality, interactive collaboration.\\n2.  **Go Live to the World:** From the main menu, the moderator selects **Live Broadcasting** and pastes the stream key from their chosen platform (e.g., YouTube). With one click, your private session is now being broadcast live to the world.\\n3.  **Engage Your Audience:** Share the public YouTube or Facebook link with your 1,000 attendees. They get a rock-solid, high-definition viewing experience powered by the world\'s best streaming infrastructure\u2014for free.\\n4.  **Bring the Audience \\"On Stage\\":** This is the magic. Want to take a question from the audience?\\n    *   Share a separate, private Plug-N-Meet join link with your attendees.\\n    *   When a user clicks it, they land in your **Waiting Room**.\\n    *   As the moderator, you can see a list of people waiting. When you\'re ready, you simply click **\\"Accept\\"** to bring a specific audience member directly into your live studio.\\n    *   They can ask their question on camera, interact with the panelists, and then, when they\'re done, you can dismiss them from the studio, and they seamlessly return to watching the public stream.\\n\\nYou have just created a professional, interactive broadcast, bringing guests \\"on stage\\" just like a real television show.\\n\\n### The Benefits Are Huge\\n\\n*   **Massive Scalability, Minimal Cost:** You only need a server powerful enough for your ~10 speakers, not 1,000 attendees. You let YouTube and Facebook handle the massive cost and complexity of global distribution for you.\\n*   **High-Quality, Controlled Production:** Your core session is clean, private, and easy to moderate. No more chaos.\\n*   **True Audience Interaction:** You still get the engagement of a live Q&A, but in a structured, professional, and manageable way.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: The Right Tool for Your Stage\\n\\nSo, can Plug-N-Meet handle a 1000-person event? The answer is yes, but the more important question is ***how***.\\n\\nWhile it\'s theoretically possible to cram a thousand users into a single session on the open-source version, it comes with extreme costs and forces you to limit interactivity (like allowing only 1-2 webcams) just to maintain stability.\\n\\nThat\'s why we empower you to do it the smart way.\\n\\nFor the vast majority of events, the **Broadcast Studio Model** is the most scalable and cost-effective solution. However, for the enterprise client who needs a massive interactive session *without compromise*, our managed **Plug-N-Meet Cloud** service is engineered to solve this challenge, offering a powerful and cost-effective alternative to other enterprise solutions.\\n\\nUltimately, it\'s not about building a bigger room; it\'s about building a better show. Whether you\'re a producer using our open-source tools or an enterprise leveraging our cloud, Plug-N-Meet provides the flexible core to do it your way.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Ready to produce your next big event?**\\n\\n*   **[Try the Live Broadcasting feature in our Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**\\n*   **[Learn more about our enterprise-grade Cloud Service](https://www.plugnmeet.cloud)**\\n*   **[Review our Scalable Deployment Guide](/docs/developer-guide/scalable-setup)**\\n*   **[Explore the Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**"},{"id":"why-we-built-plugnmeet","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/why-we-built-plugnmeet","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-10-31-why-we-built-plugnmeet.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-31-why-we-built-plugnmeet.md","title":"Why We Built Plug-N-Meet: A Founder\'s Story","description":"For years, our company has been a well-known provider of BigBlueButton hosting and support services.

We\'ve deployed, managed, and scaled it for countless clients, and we have a deep respect for the role it has played in the open-source education community. It paved the way.\\n\\nBut after years in the trenches, supporting live sessions, online classes, and events at scale, we found ourselves running into the same fundamental walls. We weren\'t just using the software; we were experiencing its architectural limits firsthand. The frustration wasn\'t just about bugs; it was about an architecture that, while powerful for its original purpose, presented challenges for the kind of elastic scalability and developer agility that modern web applications demand.\\n\\nWe realized we had a choice: continue building workarounds, or take everything we had learned and build the solution we knew our users needed.\\n\\nWe chose to build. This is the story of why Plug-N-Meet exists.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Lessons from the Trenches: The Challenges We Had to Solve\\n\\nOur decision wasn\'t born from a dislike of BigBlueButton, but from a deep understanding of its pain points at scale. We consistently faced a set of recurring challenges:\\n\\n*   **The 100-User Wall:** We saw time and again that even on powerful servers, BigBlueButton\'s performance would degrade significantly once a session crossed 100-150 concurrent users. It simply wasn\'t designed for the elastic scalability modern applications require.\\n\\n*   **The Labyrinth of Complexity:** The architecture is a mix of different programming languages and technologies, each solving a different piece of the puzzle. While brilliant in its time, this makes it incredibly difficult to maintain, debug, and\u2014most importantly\u2014add new features to. A simple change could have cascading effects across a half-dozen different services.\\n\\n*   **The Branding Straitjacket:** For our clients who wanted a true white-label experience, customization was a constant struggle. Deep branding required complex themeing and often direct code modifications, making every update a risky and time-consuming process.\\n\\n*   **The Recording Puzzle:** Recordings were a major pain point. The system was complex, and generating a single, portable MP4 file was notoriously difficult. In fact, I developed one of the first open-source solutions to try and solve this very problem, but even then, it was a patch on a fundamentally complicated system.\\n\\n*   **The Monolithic Burden:** The lack of modularity was the biggest roadblock. You couldn\'t scale one part of the system without scaling the whole thing. If recording was using all the CPU, it directly impacted live meetings. There was no separation of concerns.\\n\\n### A New Philosophy: Built on Simplicity, Modularity, and Control\\n\\nWith Plug-N-Meet, we started with a clean slate and a few core principles born directly from our frustrations.\\n\\n1.  **Radical Simplicity in Technology.**\\n    Instead of a dozen languages, we chose two: **Go** for the entire backend and **TypeScript (with React)** for the front-end. That\'s it. This decision extended to our core dependencies. We chose **LiveKit** as our media server and **NATS** for messaging, not just because they are best-in-class, but because they are also written in Go. This creates a unified, consistent, and high-performance ecosystem\u2014a topic we explore in our **[Backend Architecture Deep Dive](/blog/backend-architecture-deep-dive)**\u2014that is a joy for our developers to work in and easy for the community to contribute to.\\n\\n2.  **Modularity by Design.**\\n    Plug-N-Meet is not a monolith. It\'s a decoupled system of components that work together. The recorder, the media server, and the application logic are all separate. This means you can scale, update, or even replace one part without breaking everything else. Our new recorder\'s \\"Operational Modes\\" are a perfect example of this, a direct result of our **[recording philosophy](/blog/recording-philosophy)**. This allows you to run CPU-intensive transcoding on entirely different machines from your live recording servers, a concept we explore further in our **[Scalable Deployment Guide](/docs/developer-guide/scalable-setup)**.\\n\\n3.  **Effortless Customization.**\\n    Branding shouldn\'t be a development project. With Plug-N-Meet, deep customization is handled via a simple API and configuration objects. You can change colors, logos, and even the entire layout without ever touching our core code, as outlined in our **[Design Customization Guide](/docs/developer-guide/design-customisation)**, ensuring that your platform always feels like *your* platform.\\n\\n4.  **Empowering Everyone Through Integration.**\\n    While we provide powerful tools for developers, our philosophy has always been to make Plug-N-Meet accessible to everyone. A powerful platform shouldn\'t require a team of engineers to use. That\'s why we\'ve invested heavily in creating simple, robust plugins for the world\'s most popular CMS and LMS platforms.\\n\\n    With our official plugins for **WordPress**, **Moodle**, and **Joomla**, anyone can add a fully-featured, branded video conferencing service to their website in minutes. These integrations aren\'t just an afterthought; they are a core part of our mission to empower creators. As we\'ve detailed in our guides, you can even **[launch your own video service with WordPress](/blog/no-code-video-conferencing-service-with-wordpress)**, **[build a scalable e-learning platform with Moodle](/blog/secure-scalable-moodle-e-learning-platform)**, or **[start a no-code business with Joomla](/blog/no-code-video-conferencing-service-with-joomla)**, no coding required.\\n\\n5.  **Developer-First, Not an Afterthought.**\\n    We are not a domain-based solution that locks you into a rigid structure. We are an API-first platform designed to be a building block. Whether you use our simple plugins for WordPress and Moodle or our **[`getClientFiles` API](/docs/api/get-client-files)** for a \\"headless\\" integration, our goal is to empower you to build the exact experience you want, not force you into ours.\\n\\n6.  **Security as a Foundation, Not an Add-on.**\\n    In today\'s world, privacy is non-negotiable. We built Plug-N-Meet with a security-first mindset, offering robust **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** as a core feature, with multiple **[key management models](/blog/e2ee-key-models-guide)** to fit any security posture. This ensures that conversations are private and that not even the server can access the media streams. This commitment to privacy is woven through our entire architecture, as detailed in our **[Security Overview](/docs/security-overview)**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: Building the Road for the Future\\n\\nWe will always be grateful for the path that BigBlueButton paved. It showed the world what was possible with open-source communication. But the web has evolved, and the demands for scalability, flexibility, and developer experience have grown exponentially.\\n\\nWe built Plug-N-Meet to answer that call. It is the platform we wished we had during all those years of managing complex deployments\u2014a simpler, more powerful, and more flexible foundation for the future of real-time communication.\\n\\nWe are not building a tool for everyone. We are building a **platform for builders.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Ready to see the difference for yourself?**\\n\\n*   **[Migrating from BigBlueButton?

The host struggles to juggle different apps for polls, group activities, and notes, while the audience slowly disengages.\\n\\nAn online workshop shouldn\'t be a passive presentation. It should be a dynamic, collaborative experience. But to achieve that, you need more than just a video link; you need an integrated toolkit where every feature works together seamlessly.\\n\\nWith Plug-N-Meet, you have that toolkit. This guide will walk you through the anatomy of a perfect online workshop, showing how to use a single, unified platform to manage every stage of your event, from the initial icebreaker to the automated follow-up.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: The Blueprint - Setting Up Your Workshop for Success\\n\\nA great workshop starts with the right environment. When you create your Plug-N-Meet room, you\'re not just creating a call; you\'re setting the stage. Using the API or the dashboard, you can pre-configure the room specifically for interaction:\\n\\n*   **Enable Breakout Rooms:** Check the box to allow breakout rooms, ready for your group activities.\\n*   **Activate the Whiteboard:** Ensure the interactive whiteboard is enabled for visual collaboration.\\n*   **Keep it Open:** Unlike a formal webinar, you might start with microphones and webcams unlocked to encourage participation from the very beginning.\\n*   **Set Up Your Automation:** Provide a `webhook_url` during room creation. This is the secret ingredient for our automated follow-up later.\\n\\n### Step 2: The Icebreaker - A Visual Welcome\\n\\nForget the awkward \\"let\'s go around and say our names\\" in the chat. A great workshop starts with immediate, visual engagement.\\n\\n**The Activity:** Use the **Interactive Whiteboard** for a simple icebreaker. Upload an image of a world map. As participants join, enable **multi-user drawing mode** and ask everyone to place a dot or their name on the city they\'re joining from.\\n\\nIn seconds, you\'ve created a visual, interactive representation of your audience. It\'s a simple, powerful way to get everyone engaged and comfortable with the tools from the very first minute.\\n\\n### Step 3: The Core Activity - Deep Collaboration in Breakout Rooms\\n\\nNow for the heart of the workshop. You announce, \\"We\'re going to split into groups of four to brainstorm solutions.\\"\\n\\nWith Plug-N-Meet, this is effortless:\\n\\n1.  The host opens the **Breakout Rooms** management panel.\\n2.  They choose the number of rooms and the duration (e.g., \\"15 minutes\\").\\n3.  They can drag and drop participants into specific rooms or click **\\"Randomly Assign\\"** to have Plug-N-Meet do the work.\\n\\nThe magic is what happens *inside* these rooms. Unlike other platforms where advanced features disappear, each breakout room in Plug-N-Meet gets its own **fully functional, private interactive whiteboard and shared notepad.**\\n\\nYour groups can now brainstorm on their own canvas, create their own notes, and collaborate deeply without being distracted by the main session. As a host, you can even send a broadcast message to all rooms (\\"5 minutes left!\\") or pop into a specific room to see how they\'re doing.\\n\\n### Step 4: The Debrief - Gathering Insights with Live Polls\\n\\nThe breakout session timer ends, and everyone is automatically brought back to the main room. How do you efficiently gather the key takeaways from each group?\\n\\nThis is the perfect moment for a **Live Poll**.\\n\\nThe host creates a new poll on the fly: \\"Which proposed solution did your group find most promising?\\" with several options. As participants vote, the host sees the results update in real-time. Once the voting is closed, the host can click **\\"Publish Results,\\"** which sends a clean, graphical summary to the public chat for everyone to see and discuss. It\'s a structured, democratic, and highly efficient way to debrief.\\n\\n### Step 5: The Follow-Up - Smart, Automated Summaries\\n\\nThe workshop was a huge success. Now what? Manually downloading the recording, uploading it somewhere, and emailing a link to all attendees is a tedious, error-prone process.\\n\\nThis is where the `webhook_url` you set up in Step 1 comes into play.\\n\\n1.  The host clicks **\\"End Recording.\\"**\\n2.  A few minutes later, once the recording file is processed and ready, the Plug-N-Meet server automatically sends a notification (a webhook) to your server.\\n3.  Your system, listening for this `end_recording` event, receives a payload with the link to the downloadable MP4 file.\\n4.

You\u2019re in an important online meeting, the chat is full of crucial links, and then you accidentally hit refresh. Everything is gone. To solve this, many applications store your entire session on their backend servers. This allows them to restore your session, but it comes at a huge cost: your sensitive data is now stored permanently on someone else\'s hard drive.\\n\\nAt plugNmeet, we believe this is the wrong trade-off. We\'ve made a deliberate architectural choice to use **your browser\'s own storage** to provide a resilient experience without compromising your privacy.\\n\\nOur philosophy is simple: **if we don\'t need the data on our server to make the service work, we don\'t touch it.**\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Problem: Server Databases are Data \\"Honeypots\\"\\n\\nMost applications link your in-meeting activity to an account. They save your chat history, your whiteboard drawings, and your preferences in a large backend database.\\n\\nWhile this can be convenient, it creates a massive \\"honeypot\\" of user data. This central database becomes a prime target for data breaches. If the server is ever compromised, all of that user information is at risk.\\n\\nWe believe this is an unnecessary risk for the kind of temporary data generated during a meeting.\\n\\n## The plugNmeet Solution: Your Browser is Your Temporary Database\\n\\nTo give you a smooth experience without compromising your privacy, we use your browser\'s built-in storage (IndexedDB) for temporary session information.\\n\\nThis means that when you\'re in a meeting, data like this is stored **only on your own computer**:\\n\\n*   **Your chat history** for the current session.\\n*   The state of the **collaborative whiteboard**.\\n*   Your chosen **subtitle language**, etc.\\n\\nOur backend server has no knowledge of this information. We use this local storage for one primary reason: to make your experience resilient by restoring your session if you accidentally refresh the page.\\n\\n### The Lifecycle of Your Data: Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\\n\\nThe data stored in your browser is designed to be temporary. Here\'s how we handle it in simple terms:\\n\\n1.  **When you leave a meeting properly,** all the session data we stored in your browser is **immediately and permanently deleted.**\\n\\n2.  **If you leave abnormally** (like closing the tab), the data remains temporarily to allow you to rejoin. However, the next time you start the application, a cleanup process automatically finds and **deletes this old data** after a few hours.\\n\\nThis ensures that your browser stays clean and your session data remains ephemeral.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: Privacy and Resilience by Design\\n\\nOur decision to use client-side storage is a core part of our \\"privacy by design\\" philosophy.\\n\\nBy not collecting and storing your in-meeting activity on our servers, we can make a simple but powerful promise: **we cannot lose, misuse, or be forced to hand over data that we do not have.**\\n\\nIt\'s a simple principle that leads to a more private, more secure, and more respectful platform for everyone.

Or is it a faithful replica of a live, interactive experience?\\n\\nAt Plug-N-Meet, we believe a recording should be a perfect, trustworthy artifact. When you watch it back, the whiteboard annotations should appear at the exact moment the speaker was discussing them. The chat messages should pop up in perfect sync with the conversation. The shared presentation should be exactly as the audience saw it.\\n\\nTo achieve this perfect fidelity, we made a deliberate architectural choice for our recorder: we record the **final, rendered output**, not just the individual parts. This article explains why this headless Chrome-based approach, while CPU-intensive, is fundamentally better and more reliable than the alternatives.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Alternative: The Fragile Puzzle of Component-Based Recording\\n\\nMany systems attempt to record meetings by capturing each data stream independently:\\n*   One file for each participant\'s audio.\\n*   Another file for each video stream.\\n*   A JSON or text file containing all the chat messages with timestamps.\\n*   A separate event log for all the whiteboard drawings, pointer movements, and slide changes.\\n\\nOn the surface, this seems efficient. But it creates a massive, fragile puzzle for post-processing. The system must then try to reassemble all these disparate pieces into a single, coherent video.\\n\\nThis approach is fraught with peril:\\n*   **Synchronization Nightmares:** What if a network hiccup causes a slight drift in the timestamps between the audio and the whiteboard events? The result is a recording where the presenter is pointing at something that isn\'t there yet.\\n*   **Complexity in Playback:** To view the \\"recording,\\" you often need a special player that knows how to read all these separate files and reconstruct the session on the fly. The final output isn\'t a simple, portable video file.\\n*   **Brittle and Not Future-Proof:** If you add a new feature to your client, like emoji reactions, you also have to update your entire recording-processing logic to know how to handle and display this new \\"part.\\"\\n\\nThis method doesn\'t create a recording; it creates a complex and fragile reconstruction that is only as good as its weakest link.\\n\\n### The Plug-N-Meet Way: Recording What You Actually See\\n\\nOur philosophy is simpler and far more robust. We believe the only way to perfectly capture a live event is to record it exactly as a human participant would experience it.\\n\\nHere\u2019s how we do it:\\n1.  When a recording is initiated, we launch a **\\"virtual participant\\"** into the meeting. This is a headless Chrome browser running on the server.\\n2.  This virtual user sees and hears everything exactly as a real person would. It sees the active speaker, the shared screen, the whiteboard drawings, and the chat messages as they appear, all rendered together in a single, final view.\\n3.  We then use the industry-standard `ffmpeg` to capture the output of this browser window, encoding it directly into a standard **MP4 video file**.\\n\\nThe result is a single, self-contained video file that is a **perfect, high-fidelity replica** of the live session. What you saw is what you get.\\n\\n### The Best of Both Worlds: Fidelity and Scalability\\n\\nWe are transparent about the trade-off: running a headless browser and encoding video in real-time is a CPU-intensive task. In our previous architecture, this could mean that a server busy with post-processing a finished recording might have fewer resources available for new, live recordings.\\n\\nWe have completely solved this.\\n\\nThe new `plugnmeet-recorder` introduces **Operational Modes**, allowing you to decouple the recording pipeline.\\n*   You can run lightweight **`recorderOnly`** instances whose sole job is to join the meeting and capture the raw, high-fidelity stream. They use minimal CPU and are always ready for the next live session.\\n*   You can then run a separate fleet of **`transcoderOnly`** workers on different, even cheaper, servers. Their only job is to perform the CPU-intensive post-processing, converting the raw files into the final MP4s.\\n\\nThis architecture gives you the best of both worlds: the perfect fidelity of a headless Chrome recording and the scalability to offload the intensive work, ensuring your live meetings are never impacted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: A Commitment to Quality\\n\\nOur choice to use a headless browser for recordings is a direct reflection of our commitment to quality and reliability. A meeting recording is often a critical business asset or an essential educational resource. It needs to be perfect. By capturing the entire, rendered experience\u2014and providing a scalable architecture to manage the workload\u2014we ensure that your recordings are not just a collection of parts, but a trustworthy and professional record of what actually happened.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Ready to dive deeper into our recording architecture?**\\n\\n*   **[Explore the plugNmeet-recorder on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-recorder)**\\n*   **[Read our Scalable Deployment Guide](/docs/developer-guide/scalable-setup) to see how to use the new operational modes.**\\n*   **[Try the Live Demo to create a recording yourself](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**"},{"id":"e2ee-key-models-guide","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/e2ee-key-models-guide","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-10-29-e2ee-key-models-guide.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-29-e2ee-key-models-guide.md","title":"Who Holds the Keys?

It ensures that only the participants in a conversation can decrypt and view the media streams, not even the server itself. At plugNmeet, we\'ve implemented a robust E2EE model based on the WebRTC Insertable Streams API.\\n\\nBut \\"E2EE\\" isn\'t a single, one-size-fits-all solution. A critical question remains: **where do the encryption keys come from, and who manages them?**\\n\\nplugNmeet offers two distinct models for managing E2EE keys, controlled by a simple setting: `enabled_self_insert_encryption_key`. Understanding the difference is key to choosing the right security posture for your application.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Core Concept: Shared Secret\\n\\nIn both models, the goal is the same: every participant in a room must share the exact same secret key. This key is used to encrypt all outgoing media and decrypt all incoming media. If a user doesn\'t have the key, they can\'t participate.\\n\\nThe difference between our two models comes down to a simple question: **who generates and distributes this shared secret?**\\n\\n### Model 1: Server-Generated Keys (`enabled_self_insert_encryption_key = false`)\\n\\nThis is the **default, simplest, and most convenient** method.\\n\\n**How it works:**\\n1.  When the first participant joins an E2EE-enabled room, the **plugNmeet server** cryptographically generates a strong, random secret key for that specific room.\\n2.  As each subsequent participant joins, the plugNmeet server securely delivers this key to the new participant as part of their authentication response.\\n3.  The client\'s browser then uses this key to set up its encryption mechanism.\\n\\n**Who is this for?**\\n*   **Most standard use cases.**\\n*   Applications that need strong encryption without the complexity of building their own key management system.\\n*   Anyone who trusts their own self-hosted plugNmeet server to manage keys on a per-session basis.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\n*   **Simple to Implement:** E2EE works out of the box with no extra development work required on your part.\\n*   **Secure:** The key is generated on your trusted, self-hosted server and transmitted securely to each client. It only exists for the duration of the session.\\n\\n**The Trust Model:**\\nIn this model, you are trusting your own plugNmeet server to generate and distribute the keys. The server \\"knows\\" the key for each session, but it is designed not to store it long-term. For a self-hosted environment, this is a very strong and practical security model.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Model 2: User-Provided Keys (`enabled_self_insert_encryption_key = true`)\\n\\nThis is the **most secure and advanced** method, providing a true \\"zero-knowledge\\" architecture where not even your application handles the key.\\n\\n**How it works:**\\n1.  When this mode is enabled, the plugNmeet server **does not** generate or handle any keys.\\n2.  It becomes the users\' responsibility to securely share a secret key among themselves using a completely **out-of-band channel** (e.g., a Signal message, a password manager, or even verbally). Your application and servers never touch or see this key.\\n3.  When a user joins the meeting, the plugNmeet UI will **prompt them to manually enter the secret key**.\\n4.  The user must type or paste the pre-shared key into the prompt. Only if the key is correct will their client be able to encrypt and decrypt the media streams to participate in the call.\\n\\n**Who is this for?**\\n*   **Maximum Security & Zero-Knowledge Applications:** Use cases where you need to guarantee that your entire server infrastructure (including both the plugNmeet server and your own application backend) has absolutely no knowledge of the encryption keys.\\n*   **Journalist/Whistleblower Platforms:** Situations where proving that you cannot access user communications is a core feature.\\n*   **High-Assurance Enterprise Meetings:** For top-secret internal discussions where keys are managed by corporate security policy, not the application.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\n*   **True Zero-Knowledge:** Your servers are completely blind to the content of the conversations. The key never touches your server infrastructure, not even your application\'s frontend.\\n*   **Maximum User Control:** The security of the key is entirely in the hands of the end-users and their chosen out-of-band communication method.\\n\\n**The Trust Model:**\\nIn this model, you are not trusting any server component at all. You are only trusting the end-user clients and the security of the out-of-band mechanism they used to share the key. This is the highest level of user-controlled security you can achieve.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Quick Comparison: Which Model Should You Use?\\n\\n| Use Case                                      | Recommended Model        | Why?                                                                                             |\\n| :-------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| **A general-purpose meeting platform**        | **Server-Generated**     | Simple, secure, and requires no extra work. The default choice for most applications.            |\\n| **A secure telehealth or legal app**          | **User-Provided**        | Provides the strongest \\"zero-knowledge\\" guarantee, which may be required for compliance.         |\\n| **A private chat for a small, trusted team**  | **Server-Generated**     | The security is more than sufficient, and the convenience is high.                               |\\n| **Building a Signal/Telegram-like video app** | **User-Provided**        | Aligns with the user-controlled, zero-knowledge philosophy of those platforms.                   |\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe choice between server-generated and user-provided keys is a classic trade-off between convenience and absolute control. By offering both models, plugNmeet gives you the flexibility to choose the security posture that best fits your application\'s specific needs and threat model.\\n\\nWhether you need the simple, out-of-the-box security of server-generated keys or the zero-knowledge guarantees of a user-provided model, plugNmeet provides the tools to build a truly secure communication platform.\\n\\n---\\n**Ready to learn more?**\\n\\n*   **Read our [Security Overview](/docs/security-overview)**\\n*   **Explore the [API Documentation](/docs/api/intro)**"},{"id":"plugnmeet-next-generation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/plugnmeet-next-generation","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-10-29-plugnmeet-next-generation.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-29-plugnmeet-next-generation.md","title":"A Major Leap Forward: Announcing the Next Generation of Plug-N-Meet","description":"We are thrilled to announce a landmark update for the Plug-N-Meet ecosystem, featuring a completely redesigned client and a more powerful, scalable recorder.

These updates are the result of countless hours of development aimed at enhancing user experience, boosting performance, and providing developers with even more flexibility.\\n\\nWe\'re aiming to publish the new client **before Christmas**, but you don\'t have to wait to see what\'s coming. You can preview the future right now! Just click the **\\"Demo\\"** link from our website\'s main menu and select the **\\"Development version\\"** to get a sneak peek.\\n\\nLet\'s dive into what\u2019s new.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **The New Client: A Completely Reimagined Experience**\\n\\nWe have rebuilt the Plug-N-Meet front-end from the ground up to be lighter, faster, and more intuitive than ever before.\\n\\n**A Fresh, Modern UI**\\n\\nThe first thing you\'ll notice is the stunning new user interface. Every component, from the control bar to the settings panel, has been redesigned for a cleaner look, smoother animations, and a more logical workflow. The result is a user experience that is not just more aesthetically pleasing, but also easier to navigate.\\n\\n**Under the Hood: A Blazing-Fast and Developer-Friendly Core**\\n\\nThis isn\'t just a facelift. We\'ve modernized the entire tech stack for a massive performance boost and a superior developer experience:\\n*   **Upgraded to React 19:** Leveraging the latest features from the React framework for a more efficient UI.\\n*   **Next-Generation Whiteboard:** We\'ve integrated the newest version of Excalidraw for a more feature-rich and responsive collaborative experience.\\n*   **Vite with Rolldown:** We have migrated our build system from Webpack to the cutting-edge Vite, powered by Rolldown. This means significantly faster development builds and a more optimized, lightweight production bundle.\\n*   **A Refactored & Modernized Codebase:** The entire client has been architecturally improved, making the code cleaner, more modular, and easier for developers to understand, customize, and contribute to.\\n*   **Zero-Knowledge Security Models:** The new client brings to life our most advanced security options, including support for `enabled_self_insert_encryption_key`. This allows users to provide their own encryption keys for a true zero-knowledge session, a feature we detailed in our [guide to E2EE key models](/blog/e2ee-key-models-guide).\\n*   ...and many more improvements!\\n\\n#### **What This Upgrade Means For You**\\n\\nWe\'ve worked hard to make this transition as smooth as possible.\\n\\n*   **For Users of Our Official Plugins (WordPress, Moodle, Joomla):**\\n    You don\'t need to worry about a thing. Simply update the plugin from your platform\'s marketplace after you\'ve updated your Plug-N-Meet server. The new client will be loaded automatically.\\n\\n*   **For Developers with Custom Integrations (`getClientFiles`):**\\n    This is a critical update. To achieve the new performance standards, the client now utilizes modern **ES Modules**. This requires a small but important change to how you inject the JavaScript files into your application.\\n\\n    **The Core Logic (Language-Agnostic):**\\n    Previously, all JavaScript files could be loaded with a standard `<script>` tag. Now, you must differentiate between the main module script and the other scripts.\\n\\n    1.  When you loop through the `js_files` array returned by the API, you need to check the filename of each script.\\n    2.  If the filename **starts with `main-module.`**, you must render its `<script>` tag with `type=\\"module\\"`.\\n    3.  For all other JavaScript files, you should render the `<script>` tag as before, preferably with a `defer` attribute to avoid blocking page render.\\n\\n    This logic can be implemented in any server-side language or templating engine (Python, Node.js, Ruby, etc.) by performing a simple string check on the filename.\\n\\n    **Implementation Example (PHP):**\\n    Here is a PHP example demonstrating how to implement this conditional logic:\\n\\n    ```php\\n    <?php foreach ($api_response[\'js\'] as $js_file): ?>\\n        <?php if (str_starts_with($js_file, \'main-module.\')):\\n            <script src=\\"<?php echo $assets_path . \'/js/\' . $js_file ?>\\" type=\\"module\\"><\/script>\\n        <?php else: ?>\\n            <script src=\\"<?php echo $assets_path . \'/js/\' . $js_file ?>\\" defer=\\"defer\\"><\/script>\\n        <?php endif; ?>\\n    <?php endforeach; ?>\\n    ```\\n\\n    By following this logic, you can ensure the new, faster client loads correctly in your custom application.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **The New Recorder: A Scalable & Resilient Pipeline**\\n\\nOne of the most common bottlenecks in any live video platform is recording. Previously, as soon as a recording ended, the same server that was handling live meetings would begin the CPU-intensive task of post-processing (transcoding), which could impact the performance of other active sessions.\\n\\nWith the new `plugnmeet-recorder`, we\'ve completely solved this problem by introducing **Operational Modes**.\\n\\nEach recorder instance can now be configured to run as a specialized worker, allowing you to build a powerful, decoupled, and highly scalable recording pipeline.\\n\\n*   **`recorderOnly` Mode:** This worker\'s only job is to record the live session to a raw file. Once finished, it publishes a \\"transcoding job\\" to a queue and immediately frees itself up to record another session. It never gets bogged down by post-processing.\\n\\n*   **`transcoderOnly` Mode:** This worker does the heavy lifting. It subscribes to the job queue, picks up transcoding tasks one by one, and converts the raw files into the final MP4 format.\\n\\n*   **`both` Mode (Default):** For smaller setups, a single instance can still perform both functions, just as it did before.\\n\\n#### **Why This is a Game-Changer**\\n\\nThis new architecture allows you to build a truly professional-grade recording system:\\n*   **Scalability:** You can run a fleet of `transcoderOnly` workers on separate, cheaper VMs, processing dozens of recordings in parallel without ever affecting the performance of your live meetings.\\n*   **Resilience:** If a `transcoderOnly` worker fails, the job simply remains in the queue until another worker picks it up. No recordings are lost.\\n*   **Performance:** Your `recorderOnly` workers stay lightweight and responsive, ensuring the quality of your live session recordings is never compromised by CPU load.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nThis release marks a significant step forward in our mission to provide the most powerful, flexible, and high-performance open-source video conferencing platform. The redesigned client delivers a world-class user experience, while the new recorder architecture provides the scalability and resilience needed for enterprise-grade deployments.\\n\\nWe can\'t wait for you to experience the new Plug-N-Meet.\\n\\n**Ready to upgrade?**\\n\\n*   **[Explore the Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**\\n*   **[Review the updated API Documentation](/docs/api/get-client-files)**\\n*   **[Check out the Live Demo to see the new UI in action](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**"},{"id":"no-code-video-conferencing-service-with-joomla","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/no-code-video-conferencing-service-with-joomla","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-10-28-no-code-video-conferencing-service-with-joomla.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-28-no-code-video-conferencing-service-with-joomla.md","title":"How to Launch Your Own Video Conferencing Service with Joomla (No Code Required)","description":"Have you ever dreamed of launching your own online service or \\"micro-SaaS,\\" but felt blocked by the biggest hurdle: coding?

You\'re not alone. The idea of building, managing, and scaling a software product is daunting.\\n\\nBut what if you could create a fully branded, monetized, and professional video conferencing service using a tool you already know and trust?\\n\\nWith the power of Joomla and the **plugNmeet** component, you can. This guide will walk you through the simple, step-by-step process of launching your own white-label video conferencing service, without writing a single line of code.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The \\"No-Code\\" Tech Stack: The Three Simple Pieces\\n\\nTo build your service, you only need three things:\\n\\n1.  **A Joomla Website:** Your command center and storefront.\\n2.  **The Plug-N-Meet Joomla Component:** The free tool that integrates video conferencing directly into your site.\\n3.  **A Plug-N-Meet Server:** The engine that powers your video calls.\\n\\nThat\'s it. Let\'s get started.\\n\\n### Step 1: Get Your Video Conferencing Engine (The Power of Ownership)\\n\\nThe \\"engine\\" is the server that handles all the complex video and audio processing. For ultimate control, privacy, and cost-effectiveness, the best path is to **self-host the open-source Plug-N-Meet server**. This gives you complete ownership of your platform and data. Thanks to our automated installation script, you can get a production-ready server running on a fresh Ubuntu instance with just a few commands.\\n\\nHowever, if your goal is to get started instantly without touching a command line, the official **[plugNmeet Cloud](https://www.plugnmeet.cloud)** service is the perfect \\"no-code\\" alternative. You can sign up for a free account to test your service and get your credentials immediately.\\n\\nWhether you choose to self-host or use the cloud, you will get an **API Key** and **API Secret**. Think of these credentials as the keys to your video engine. Keep them safe!\\n\\n### Step 2: Integrate into Joomla (The 5-Minute Setup)\\n\\nNow, let\'s connect your engine to your Joomla site.\\n\\n1.  From your Joomla administrator panel, navigate to **System > Install > Extensions**.\\n2.  Select the **Install from Web** tab and search for **\\"plugnmeet\\"**.\\n3.  Find the official Plug-N-Meet component and click **Install**.\\n4.  After installation, navigate to **System > Global Configuration** and select **plugNmeet** from the components list.\\n5.  Carefully copy your **API Key** and **API Secret** from your server and paste them into the corresponding fields.\\n\\nClick **Save**. Congratulations, you now have a fully functional video conferencing platform running directly on your Joomla site.\\n\\n### Step 3: Create Your \\"Product\\" - The Meeting Rooms\\n\\nYour \\"product\\" is the different types of meeting rooms you will offer.\\n\\n1.  From the Joomla administrator panel, go to **Components > Plug N Meet > Manage Rooms**.\\n2.  Click **+ New** and define your service offering. For example:\\n    *   **\\"Basic Meeting Room\\":** Limit to 10 participants and a 60-minute duration.\\n    *   **\\"Premium Webinar Room\\":** Allow up to 100 participants, unlimited duration, and enable **Cloud Recording**.\\n\\nBy enabling or disabling features, you can easily create different value tiers. Once you\'ve configured a room, click **Save**.\\n\\n### Step 4: Monetize It - Putting a Price Tag on Your Rooms\\n\\nThis is where your business comes to life. Joomla\'s built-in Access Control Levels (ACL) and the plugNmeet component\'s permissions work together perfectly here.\\n\\nThe workflow is simple:\\n\\n1.  **Use a Joomla Membership Extension:** Install a membership or e-commerce extension. Use it to create subscription plans (e.g., \\"Silver Tier,\\" \\"Gold Tier\\") that automatically assign paying customers to specific Joomla user groups.\\n2.  **Create a Premium Menu Item:** Navigate to **Menus > Main Menu** and click **+ Add New Menu Item**.\\n3.  For the **Menu Item Type**, select **Plug N Meet > Single room**.\\n4.  In the **Select a room** dropdown, choose the \\"Premium Webinar Room\\" you created.\\n5.  **Restrict Access:** This is the key step where you define what different user tiers can do.\\n    *   **Control Room Access:** In the menu item\'s settings, set the **Access** level to your paid user groups (e.g., \\"Silver Tier\\" and \\"Gold Tier\\"). Now, only paying subscribers will be able to see and access the meeting room.\\n    *   **Control Feature Access:** Go to **Components > Plug N Meet > Manage Rooms** and edit your premium room. In the **Permission** tab, you can set even more granular rules. For example, you could allow your \\"Gold Tier\\" members to both watch and **download recordings**, while \\"Silver Tier\\" members can only stream them.\\n\\nThis powerful combination allows you to create sophisticated subscription models with fine-grained control over who can access what content and features. You\'ve successfully created a paywall for your premium video service.\\n\\n### Step 5: Brand It and Make It Your Own\\n\\nFinally, make the service look like yours.\\n\\n1.  Navigate to **System > Global Configuration > plugNmeet**.\\n2.  Go to the **Design Customization** tab.\\n3.  Here, you can upload your own logo and change the primary and secondary colors to match your brand identity.\\n\\nIn just a few clicks, you\'ve transformed the user interface into a completely white-labeled experience.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: You\'re a SaaS Founder Now\\n\\nLet\'s recap. In less than an hour, using only Joomla and a membership extension, you have:\\n\\n*   Launched a fully functional video conferencing service.\\n*   Created tiered products with different features.\\n*   Integrated a payment system to monetize your service.\\n*   Customized the branding to make it completely your own.\\n\\nYou didn\'t just add a feature to your website; you built a business. This is the power of the no-code movement combined with flexible, API-first platforms like plugNmeet.

From your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New**.\\n2.  Search for **\\"plugnmeet\\"** and click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.\\n3.  A new \\"Plug-N-Meet\\" menu will appear. Go to **Plug-N-Meet > Settings**.\\n4.  Carefully copy your **API Key** and **API Secret** from your server and paste them into the corresponding fields in the plugin settings.\\n\\nClick **Save Changes**. Congratulations, you now have a fully functional video conferencing platform running directly on your WordPress site.\\n\\n### Step 3: Create Your \\"Product\\" - The Meeting Rooms\\n\\nYour \\"product\\" is the different types of meeting rooms you will offer. You can create different tiers or packages.\\n\\n1.  Go to **Plug-N-Meet > Rooms** and click **Add New**.\\n2.  Here, you can define your service offering. For example:\\n    *   **\\"Basic Meeting Room\\":** Maybe this has a limit of 10 participants and a 60-minute duration.\\n    *   **\\"Premium Webinar Room\\":** This could allow up to 100 participants, have an unlimited duration, and have **Cloud Recording** enabled.\\n\\nBy enabling or disabling features like recording, you can easily create different value tiers for your service. Once you\'ve configured a room, click **Submit**.\\n\\n### Step 4: Monetize It - Putting a Price Tag on Your Rooms\\n\\nThis is where your business comes to life. To sell access to your rooms, you can use a popular (and often free) WordPress e-commerce or membership plugin. For this example, we\'ll use the concept behind plugins like **WooCommerce** or **Paid Memberships Pro**.\\n\\nThe workflow is simple:\\n\\n1.  **Create a \\"Product\\" or \\"Membership Level\\"** in your chosen e-commerce plugin. For example, a \\"Pro Monthly Subscription\\" that costs $20/month.\\n2.  **Create a new Page** in WordPress for your premium meeting room (e.g., a page named \\"Pro Members\' Weekly Call\\").\\n3.  **Paste the Shortcode:** Go back to **Plug-N-Meet > Rooms**, copy the shortcode for your \\"Premium Webinar Room,\\" and paste it into the content of your new page.\\n4.  **Restrict Access:** This is the key step. Use your e-commerce plugin\'s functionality to restrict access to this new page so that **only users who have purchased the \\"Pro Monthly Subscription\\" can view it.**\\n\\nNow, when a non-paying user tries to visit the page, they\'ll be prompted to subscribe. When a paying member visits, they\'ll see the login form for their exclusive meeting room. You\'ve successfully created a paywall for your video service.\\n\\n### Step 5: Brand It and Make It Your Own\\n\\nFinally, make the service look like yours.\\n\\n1.  Go to **Plug-N-Meet > Settings** and scroll down to **Design Customization**.\\n2.  Here, you can upload your own logo and change the primary and secondary colors to match your brand identity.\\n\\nIn just a few clicks, you\'ve transformed the user interface into a completely white-labeled experience.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: You\'re a SaaS Founder Now\\n\\nLet\'s recap.

You\'re looking for control. You want to own your brand, manage your audience, and create a unique, professional presentation without being locked into the expensive, rigid ecosystem of proprietary tools like Zoom Webinars or GoToWebinar.\\n\\nMany open-source projects offer a basic meeting experience. But a webinar is not just a meeting. It has a different structure, different roles, and different goals. You need a platform that understands this distinction.\\n\\nAt plugNmeet, we believe the best webinar experience isn\'t a one-size-fits-all tool. It\'s a flexible, API-first platform that gives you the building blocks to create the *exact* webinar workflow you need. This article explains how.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What Makes a Webinar Different?\\n\\nA webinar is a performance. It has a cast, a stage, and an audience. This requires a specific set of features that a standard meeting tool often lacks:\\n\\n1.  **Clear Roles:** You need a clear distinction between presenters (who can speak and share their screen) and attendees (who primarily listen and watch).\\n2.  **Audience Engagement Tools:** You need structured ways for the audience to interact, like Q&A sessions, polls, and hand-raising.\\n3.  **A Branded \\"Stage\\":** The experience should feel like your event, with your branding, not a generic third-party application.\\n4.  **Post-Webinar Automation:** The recording is a valuable asset. You need to be able to access it easily and automate what happens next.\\n\\nHere\u2019s how plugNmeet is architected to deliver on all four points.\\n\\n## 1. The Digital Green Room: Unmatched Control for Hosts and Presenters\\n\\nWith most webinar software, you\'re stuck with rigid, predefined roles. plugNmeet provides a flexible, multi-layered system that separates the job of **moderating the audience** from the job of **presenting the content**.\\n\\n*   **How We Solve It:**\\n    1.  **You Pre-Configure the Rules:** Before the webinar begins, you decide the default experience for your attendees. When creating a room via our API, you can pass a `default_lock_settings` object to start with everything locked down: microphones, webcams, screen sharing, etc. This creates a secure \\"digital green room\\" where your audience joins in a listen-only mode by default.\\n\\n    2.  **The Admin Moderates the Audience:** The user designated as `is_admin: true` has full control over the audience. During the live event, the admin can:\\n        *   **Unlock a feature globally:** For example, unlock the chat for everyone during a Q&A session.\\n        *   **Grant permission individually:** Click on a specific attendee\'s name and allow them to unmute their microphone to ask a question, without giving them any other privileges.\\n\\n    3.  **The Presenter Controls the Content:** The admin can designate any user as the **Presenter**. This is a special role focused on content delivery. The Presenter has unique abilities that no one else has, not even the admin, such as:\\n        *   Uploading PDF or Office documents to the whiteboard.\\n        *   Changing pages on an uploaded document for everyone to see.\\n\\nThis separation of roles is incredibly powerful. Your main speaker (the Presenter) can focus on delivering their content, while a separate host (the Admin) can focus on managing the audience, fielding questions, and ensuring the event runs smoothly. It\'s a system designed for a professional, team-run webinar.\\n\\n## 2. Beyond Chat: Structured Engagement with Polls and Q&A\\n\\nIn a large webinar, using the main chat for questions is a recipe for chaos. Important questions get buried in a flood of \\"hellos\\" and general comments. A professional event requires professional tools for audience interaction.\\n\\n*   **How We Solve It:** plugNmeet provides tools designed for structured engagement, moving beyond a simple chat window.\\n    *   **Live Polls for Q&A and Quizzes:** This is the perfect tool for structured interaction. The host can create a poll on the fly with multiple options, essentially creating a live quiz or a Q&A session. Attendees vote, and the host sees the results update in real-time. When the poll ends, the host can **publish the results**, sharing a clean, graphical summary with the entire audience. This is a clean, manageable, and professional way to gauge opinion or get answers to specific questions.\\n    *   **Raise Hand:** For moderated verbal questions, attendees can use the \\"Raise Hand\\" feature to get the host\'s attention without interrupting the speaker.\\n    *   **Chat for Messaging:** The chat remains available for general messaging and file sharing, keeping it separate from the structured Q&A happening in the polls.\\n\\n## 3. Your Stage, Your Brand\\n\\nYour webinar is your show. It shouldn\'t look and feel like a Zoom meeting.\\n\\n*   **How We Solve It:** As we detailed in our post on true white-labeling, plugNmeet offers deep customization. You can change the colors, add your logo, and even use our `getClientFiles` API to completely rebuild the layout, creating a fully branded, seamless experience for your audience.\\n\\n## 4. The After-Show: Owning Your Content\\n\\nWith SaaS platforms, your recording is often trapped on their cloud, subject to their retention policies and pricing.\\n\\n*   **How We Solve It:** With plugNmeet, you own your content. Recordings are saved directly to your own server. And with our `recording_proceeded` webhook, you can build powerful post-webinar automations. For example, you can automatically:\\n    *   Upload the recording to your YouTube channel.\\n    *   Add the video to a \\"past webinars\\" section on your website.\\n    *   Send an email to all attendees with a link to the recording.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: Stop Searching for a Tool, Start Building on a Platform\\n\\nWhen you search for **open source webinar software**, don\'t settle for a rigid, pre-built tool that forces you into its workflow.\\n\\nChoose a platform.\\n\\nplugNmeet provides the flexible, powerful, and open-source foundation you need to build a professional, branded, and automated webinar experience that is truly your own.\\n\\nAnd if you\'re running your community on a platform like **WordPress or Joomla**, the journey is even easier.

This experience is clunky, disjointed, and it breaks the seamless learning environment you\'ve worked so hard to build.\\n\\nAt plugNmeet, we believe this is a fundamentally flawed workflow. That\'s why we made a deliberate architectural choice: to be a **plugin-first platform**, not just another standalone app.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Friction of the Standalone App\\n\\nStandalone video conferencing tools are powerful, but when used alongside an existing platform, they create unnecessary friction:\\n\\n1.  **The Jarring Context Switch:** Sending users to an external domain is a disruptive experience. You lose control over the branding, the user journey, and you pull your users out of the very ecosystem you want them to engage with.\\n\\n2.  **The User Management Nightmare:** Your LMS or CMS already has a robust user database with roles and permissions. A standalone video app forces you to manage a second, parallel set of users, or to build and maintain a complex single sign-on (SSO) integration.\\n\\n3.  **The Siloed Data:** When a meeting is over, where does the recording go? Where are the chat logs? With a standalone app, this valuable data is trapped on a third-party cloud, completely disconnected from the course, article, or user group it belongs to.\\n\\n## Our Philosophy: A Deeply Integrated Communication Layer\\n\\nWe believe that for platforms like Moodle, WordPress, or Joomla, video conferencing shouldn\'t be a separate destination. It should be a **native feature**, a deeply integrated communication layer.\\n\\nBy focusing on plugins, we allow you to:\\n\\n*   **Leverage Your Existing Infrastructure:** Our plugins use your existing user database. A teacher in Moodle is a teacher in plugNmeet. A student is a student. There are no new accounts to create and no complex authentication to manage. It just works.\\n\\n*   **Create a Seamless User Experience:** Users never have to leave your domain. They join a live class directly from the course page. They participate in a webinar without ever seeing a third-party logo. The entire experience feels like a natural extension of your own platform.\\n\\n*   **Keep Data Contextual and Connected:** When a meeting is recorded, the recording automatically appears on the relevant course page in Moodle. The data belongs to the context in which it was created, making it easy for users to find and for you to manage.\\n\\n### A Real-World Example: The Moodle Workflow\\n\\nImagine a teacher setting up a live class. With the plugNmeet plugin:\\n\\n1.  She is already logged into her Moodle course.\\n2.  She clicks \\"Add an activity or resource\\" and selects \\"plugNmeet.\\"\\n3.  She sets the time and a few parameters, and the meeting is created.\\n\\nFor the student, the process is even simpler. They log into their course, see the link for the live session, and click it. They are instantly and securely joined to the meeting. There are no new tabs, no external apps to launch, and no confusion.\\n\\nThis is the power of a plugin-first approach.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Our Commitment to the Ecosystem\\n\\nWe are not trying to build a separate island for your users to visit. We are building the bridges that bring powerful, self-hosted video communication directly into the platforms you already use and trust.\\n\\nOur Moodle plugin is just the beginning. Our vision is for plugNmeet to be the native, self-hosted video layer for every major LMS and CMS. We are actively working to expand our ecosystem of plugins and welcome community contributions to bring plugNmeet to even more platforms.\\n\\nplugNmeet isn\'t a destination; it\'s a feature.

However, when it\'s time for a live virtual class, many are forced to send their students to an external, generic video conferencing link. This experience is often disjointed, and the tools provided are frequently limited to passive screen sharing.\\n\\nWhat if your live classroom felt like a native part of Moodle? What if you could move beyond one-way screen sharing to a truly interactive and collaborative canvas, all while maintaining the highest levels of security and performance?\\n\\nBy integrating the **plugNmeet** activity module into Moodle, you can achieve exactly that. This post explores how to leverage plugNmeet\'s powerful, built-in collaborative tools\u2014the interactive whiteboard and shared notepad\u2014to build a superior e-learning platform.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Beyond Screen Sharing: The Interactive Whiteboard as a Presentation Tool\\n\\nScreen sharing is a one-way street. It\u2019s a passive experience where students watch you click through slides. An interactive whiteboard, however, is a two-way conversation.\\n\\nOur whiteboard, powered by the excellent **Excalidraw** engine, is more than just a blank canvas; it\'s a dynamic teaching surface. Its most powerful feature for educators is the ability to **upload Microsoft Office or LibreOffice documents (like PowerPoint, Word, or Excel) directly onto the canvas.**\\n\\nHere\u2019s how it transforms a standard lesson:\\n\\n1.  An instructor uploads their existing PowerPoint presentation.\\n2.  plugNmeet automatically converts each slide into a high-resolution image and places it on the whiteboard, arranged in the correct page order.\\n3.  The instructor can then navigate through the slides with a simple next/previous page interface, just like in native presentation software. They can draw, annotate, and highlight key concepts directly on top of their slides, creating a much more engaging and dynamic presentation.\\n\\nBut it doesn\'t stop there. As a moderator, you have full classroom control. With a single click, you can switch to **multi-user drawing mode**, allowing students to collaboratively solve a problem, annotate a diagram, or brainstorm ideas directly on the shared canvas.\\n\\n### The Digital Scratchpad: Collaborative Note-Taking with the Shared Notepad\\n\\nComplementing the visual nature of the whiteboard is the **Shared Notepad**. Powered by the robust and proven **Etherpad-lite** engine, this tool provides a real-time, collaborative text editor within the meeting.\\n\\nIt\u2019s the perfect digital scratchpad for:\\n\\n*   Taking collective class notes that everyone can contribute to and save.\\n*   Brainstorming lists and ideas in a structured text format.\\n*   Sharing and collaboratively editing snippets of code or text.\\n\\nThe notepad provides a persistent space for text-based collaboration, ensuring that no ideas are lost.\\n\\n### The Engine Under the Hood: Secure, Scalable, and Fast\\n\\nThese collaborative features are not just bolted on; they are powered by a backend architecture designed for performance and security.\\n\\n*   **Instant Synchronization:** All whiteboard annotations\u2014every line, shape, and text box\u2014are synchronized across all participants in near real-time. This is made possible by our high-performance **NATS JetStream** messaging system, which ensures a smooth, lag-free experience.\\n\\n*   **Secure by Design:** This rapid synchronization works perfectly even with **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) enabled** for the whiteboard. You can have a highly interactive and collaborative session with the peace of mind that all visual data is fully encrypted.\\n\\n*   **Scalable Foundation:** This architecture is designed to scale, ensuring these features work just as seamlessly with a large class as they do with a small group.\\n\\n*(Note: While the whiteboard supports E2EE, the Etherpad-lite engine for the shared notepad does not currently operate under the E2EE model.)*\\n\\n### A Native Moodle Experience\\n\\nThe best part is that all of this functionality is available as a **native Moodle activity**. Because plugNmeet is designed for deep integration, users never leave your Moodle site. There are no jarring redirects to an external URL; the entire virtual classroom loads directly within your course page, creating a truly seamless experience that feels like a natural part of your platform.\\n\\nThis is made possible by our unique architecture, which leverages an API like `getClientFiles`. Instead of trapping the classroom in a restrictive `<iframe>`, this API allows the Moodle plugin to load the client\'s components directly. This not only provides a native feel but also enables powerful, on-the-fly customization. From the Moodle plugin settings, you can instantly adjust brand colors and change logos, creating a fully white-labeled experience without ever touching a line of code or worrying about the underlying complexity. It reinforces your brand, simplifies the user journey, and keeps all learning activities tightly integrated within your platform.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion: Build a Better Classroom\\n\\nBy combining Moodle with plugNmeet, you are not just adding a video link to your course; you are building a truly integrated, secure, and scalable e-learning platform. You are empowering your educators with tools that are far more engaging than passive screen sharing, fostering a new level of collaboration and interaction in the virtual classroom.\\n\\nAnd for the educators and course creators on the front lines, you don\'t need to understand the technical complexity to reap the benefits. We\'ve designed the Plug-N-Meet Moodle plugin to be incredibly simple to use. If you can add a quiz to your course, you can add a powerful virtual classroom. **[Learn how to get started with our no-code video conferencing guide for Moodle](/blog/no-code-video-conferencing-moodle)**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Ready to build your next-generation e-learning platform?**\\n\\n*   **Learn more about our [Moodle Integration](/docs/user-guide/moodle-integration)**\\n*   **Try the whiteboard and other features in our [Live Demo](https://demo.plugnmeet.com/landing.html)**\\n*   **Explore our [Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**"},{"id":"backend-architecture-deep-dive","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/backend-architecture-deep-dive","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-10-27-backend-architecture-deep-dive.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-27-backend-architecture-deep-dive.md","title":"Why We Chose LiveKit and NATS: A Deep Dive into Our Backend Architecture","description":"Every great application is built on a foundation of smart architectural choices.

For a real-time video conferencing platform, these choices are the difference between a smooth, reliable experience and a frustrating mess of lag, dropped calls, and connection errors.\\n\\nWhen we designed plugNmeet, we had a clear set of goals: the platform needed to be high-performance, horizontally scalable, resilient, and easy for developers to build upon. This led us to make two fundamental decisions for our backend: we chose **LiveKit** for our media server and **NATS** for our real-time messaging layer.\\n\\nThis article is a deep dive into the \\"why\\" behind these critical choices.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Two Pillars of Real-Time Communication\\n\\nAt its core, any serious video conferencing platform has to solve two distinct problems. But for a project like plugNmeet, it\'s not enough to just make them work. The solution must also be:\\n\\n*   **Easy to Scale:** Able to grow from handling a few dozen users to many thousands without a complete re-architecture.\\n*   **Highly Available:** Resilient to failure, ensuring that the loss of a single component doesn\'t bring the entire system down.\\n*   **Resource-Efficient & Cost-Effective:** Designed to run on reasonable hardware, keeping operational costs low for everyone.\\n*   **Easy to Manage:** Simple to deploy and maintain, even for small teams or individual developers.\\n\\nOur architectural philosophy was to choose a best-in-class open-source tool for each of the two main challenges\u2014**Media Routing** and **Signaling**\u2014that met all of these demanding criteria.\\n\\n1.  **Media Routing:** How do you efficiently get audio and video streams from each participant to every other participant?\\n2.  **Signaling & State Management:** How do you instantly deliver all the other real-time information that makes a meeting dynamic and interactive?\\n\\n## Pillar 1: LiveKit - The High-Performance Media Engine\\n\\nIn the early days of WebRTC, many apps used a peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh. This works for a 1-on-1 call, but it fails catastrophically as you add more people. Each participant has to upload their video stream separately to every other person, quickly overwhelming their internet connection.\\n\\nThe modern solution is a **Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)**. An SFU is a server that acts as a traffic cop. Each participant sends their video stream to the SFU just *once*, and the SFU then forwards that stream to all other participants.\\n\\nFor our SFU, we chose **LiveKit**, and here\u2019s why:\\n\\n*   **High Performance & Efficiency:** LiveKit is written in Go, making it incredibly fast and resource-efficient. It can handle a large number of concurrent users and streams on a single server, which aligns with our goal of providing a cost-effective solution.\\n*   **Built-in Scalability:** LiveKit is designed to be clustered, and it uses Redis to manage state across multiple nodes. This provides a clear, documented path to the massive scale required by our largest users.\\n*   **Modern Features by Default:** LiveKit comes with critical, out-of-the-box support for modern WebRTC features like **Simulcast** (sending multiple quality streams) and **Dynacast** (intelligently pausing streams). This allows plugNmeet to automatically adapt to each user\'s network conditions, dramatically improving reliability.\\n*   **Secure and Open Source:** As an open-source project itself, LiveKit aligns with our core philosophy of transparency. It also has built-in support for passing through End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) media, which is essential for our **[security model](/docs/security-overview)**.\\n\\nIn short, by building on top of LiveKit, we didn\'t have to reinvent the wheel. We inherited a powerful, battle-tested media engine, allowing us to focus on building the application logic and features that make plugNmeet unique.\\n\\n## Pillar 2: NATS JetStream - The Resilient and Secure Nervous System\\n\\nWhile LiveKit handles the heavy media streams, we needed a separate system for all the other real-time data that makes a meeting interactive. Our \\"privacy and security first\\" design principle demanded a solution that was not only fast and scalable but also fundamentally secure. This is why we chose **NATS**.\\n\\nMore specifically, we leverage **NATS JetStream**, the powerful persistence layer built into the NATS ecosystem. JetStream\'s combination of high performance and a robust, built-in security model made it the perfect choice to serve as the resilient nervous system for our platform. As detailed in our **[Security and Privacy Overview](/docs/security-overview)**, NATS provides a critical defense-in-depth layer for all signaling and application data.\\n\\nHere\u2019s why JetStream was the perfect choice for plugNmeet:\\n\\n*   **Multi-Layered Security:** NATS provides a robust, defense-in-depth security model at the messaging layer, which operates in addition to our application-level E2EE.\\n    *   **Encryption in Transit:** All connections from clients to the NATS cluster are secured using **TLS**. This encrypts all signaling data while it\'s on the wire, protecting it from eavesdropping.\\n    *   **Fine-Grained Authorization:** This is where the real power lies. When a user authenticates, the `plugnmeet-server` dynamically generates a unique set of permissions for that specific user session. These permissions strictly define which NATS subjects the user is allowed to publish to and subscribe from, typically scoped by `roomId` and `userId`. This enforces a true **principle of least privilege**, making it architecturally impossible for a user in one room to access data from another.\\n    *   **Encrypted Authorization Payloads:** As an additional layer of security, Plug-N-Meet leverages NATS\'s built-in `xkey` feature. The `plugnmeet-server` uses a designated private key to sign and encrypt the authorization JWT before sending it to the NATS auth callout server. This ensures that even the authorization payload itself is protected in transit, providing a robust, multi-layered security model for user authentication.\\n\\n*   **Scalable Request Processing with Queue Workers:** For critical client-server interactions, like fetching the initial user list, we leverage JetStream\'s powerful **queue worker pattern**. When a client sends a request, it\'s published to a stream. Our backend `plugnmeet-server` instances subscribe to this stream as a **queue group**, and NATS ensures that each request is delivered to only **one** available server. This provides automatic, built-in load balancing for our core application logic.\\n\\n*   **High-Performance Streaming for Real-Time Data:** For other real-time data like **chat messages** or **collaborative whiteboard** drawing data, we use JetStream\'s high-performance streaming capabilities to ensure fast and reliable delivery to all participants in a room.\\n\\n*   **Built for Resilience:** NATS is designed from the ground up for clustering and self-healing. If one NATS node fails, clients will automatically reconnect to another, ensuring the \\"nervous system\\" of your meetings stays online.\\n\\nBy using NATS for its deep security model, performance, and resilience, we built a backend that is fast, secure, and remarkably easy to scale.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion: A Foundation Built for the Future\\n\\nThe choice of LiveKit and NATS JetStream was deliberate. By combining a best-in-class media server with a best-in-class streaming platform, we\'ve created a platform that is:\\n\\n*   **Performant:** Handling both media and signaling with specialized, high-speed tools.\\n*   **Scalable:** With clear, documented paths for clustering each component.\\n*   **Resilient:** With built-in failover and self-healing capabilities.\\n*   **Flexible:** Allowing us to build powerful, decoupled features like our auto-scaling recorders.\\n\\nBut there\'s one more crucial element that ties this all together: **the underlying technology**. Both LiveKit and NATS are written in **Go**, one of the most powerful languages for modern, concurrent network services. This was no accident. We deliberately chose to write the core `plugnmeet-server` in Go as well.\\n\\nThis creates a **unified, high-performance ecosystem**. Our developers can move seamlessly between components, leading to faster development cycles, easier maintenance, and a more cohesive and stable platform for our users. It means that when you build with plugNmeet, you\'re building on a consistent and coherent technology stack from top to bottom.\\n\\nThe ultimate benefit of this Go-based approach is in the final deployment. The entire `plugnmeet-server` compiles down to a **single, dependency-free binary file**. This makes deployment incredibly simple and portable. You can run it as a standalone service on a bare-metal server or package it into a minimal, highly secure Docker container. There are no language runtimes to manage and no complex dependencies to install\u2014just a single file that works.\\n\\nWhen you choose plugNmeet, you\'re not just getting an application. You\'re getting a thoughtfully designed architecture built on a foundation you can trust.\\n\\n---\\n**Want to learn more?**\\n\\n*   **Review our [Security and Privacy Overview](/docs/security-overview)**\\n*   **Dive deep into our [E2EE Key Models](/blog/e2ee-key-models-guide)**\\n*   **Read our [Scalable Deployment Guide](/docs/developer-guide/scalable-setup)**\\n*   **Explore the [Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-server)**"},{"id":"build-video-conferencing-app-in-under-an-hour","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/build-video-conferencing-app-in-under-an-hour","editUrl":"https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-docs/edit/main/blog/2025-10-26-build-video-conferencing-app-in-under-an-hour.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-26-build-video-conferencing-app-in-under-an-hour.md","title":"How to Build Your Own Video Conferencing App in Under an Hour","description":"Building a video conferencing application sounds like a monumental task.

With **plugNmeet**, you can.\\n\\nThis guide will show you the three core steps to building your own video app using plugNmeet\'s API-first architecture.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Old Way: The Mountain of Complexity\\n\\nBefore we show you the easy way, it\'s important to appreciate the problems plugNmeet solves. Building a WebRTC app from scratch requires you to become an expert in:\\n\\n1.  **Signaling:** Creating a system (usually with WebSockets) to coordinate connections between users.\\n2.  **NAT Traversal:** Setting up and managing STUN/TURN servers to allow users behind firewalls to connect to each other.\\n3.  **Media Server (SFU):** Deploying and scaling a Selective Forwarding Unit (like LiveKit, Mediasoup, or Janus) to efficiently route video and audio streams.\\n4.  **Backend Logic:** Writing an application server to manage rooms, users, and permissions.\\n5.  **Frontend UI:** Building a complete user interface from scratch to handle video elements, buttons, chat, and more.\\n\\nThis is a massive undertaking.\\n\\n## The plugNmeet Way: An API-First Framework\\n\\nplugNmeet bundles all of this complexity into a single, open-source server that you can install with an automated script. It provides you with a simple, powerful set of APIs that act as your building blocks.\\n\\nHere\'s how you build your app in three steps.\\n\\n### Step 1: Set Up the Backend (15 Minutes)\\n\\nFirst, you need the plugNmeet server, which includes LiveKit for media and NATS for messaging. You can install everything on a fresh Ubuntu server using our automated installation script.\\n\\n```bash\\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-install/main/install.sh\\nchmod +x install.sh\\n./install.sh\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s it. You now have a production-ready media server and API endpoint. The script will provide you with your `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET`, which you\'ll need for the next step.\\n\\n### Step 2: Control the Backend with an API Call (10 Minutes)\\n\\nNext, your application\'s backend needs to communicate with the Plug-N-Meet server to create a room and generate a join token for a user. This is done with a simple server-side API call.\\n\\nYou can use our official [PHP SDK](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-sdk-php) or [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-sdk-js), or call the API directly. Here\u2019s a robust example in PHP that checks if a room is active before creating it:\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\nrequire __DIR__ . \\"/plugNmeetConnect.php\\";\\n\\n// Step 1: Configuration\\n$config = new stdClass();\\n$config->plugnmeet_server_url = \\"https://your-plug-n-meet.com\\"; // Your server URL\\n$config->plugnmeet_api_key = \\"API_KEY\\"; // Your API Key\\n$config->plugnmeet_secret = \\"SECRET\\"; // Your API Secret\\n\\n$connect = new plugNmeetConnect($config);\\n\\n// Step 2: Room and User definitions\\n$roomId = \\"room01\\"; // Must be unique. You can also use $connect->getUUID();\\n$user_full_name = \\"Your Name\\";\\n$userId = \\"your-unique-user-id\\"; // Must be unique for each user.\\n\\n// Define all the features for this specific room.\\n$roomMetadata = array(\\n    \\"room_features\\" => array(\\n        \\"allow_webcams\\" => true,\\n        \\"allow_screen_share\\" => true,\\n        \\"room_duration\\" => 0 // 0 = no limit\\n    ),\\n    // ... and many more options\\n);\\n\\n// Step 3: The Logic Flow - Check, Create, Join\\n$isRoomActive = false;\\n$output = new stdClass();\\n$output->status = false;\\n\\n// 3.1 Check if the room already exists\\n$res = $connect->isRoomActive($roomId);\\nif ($res->getStatus()) {\\n    $isRoomActive = $res->isActive();\\n}\\n\\n// 3.2 If not, create the room\\nif (!$isRoomActive) {\\n    $create = $connect->createRoom($roomId, \\"Test room\\", \\"Welcome to room\\", 0, \\"\\", $roomMetadata);\\n    if ($create->getStatus()) {\\n        $isRoomActive = true;\\n    } else {\\n        // Handle room creation failure\\n        die($create->getResponseMsg());\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// 3.3 Generate the join token\\nif ($isRoomActive) {\\n    $join = $connect->getJoinToken($roomId, $user_full_name, $userId, true);\\n    if ($join->getStatus()) {\\n        // We have the token. Now we can build the URL.\\n        $accessToken = $join->getToken();\\n        $url = $config->plugnmeet_server_url . \\"?access_token=\\" . $accessToken;\\n        echo \\"Join URL: \\" . $url;\\n    } else {\\n        // Handle token generation failure\\n        die($join->getResponseMsg());\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis script creates a room and gives you a unique URL with a token that grants \\"John Doe\\" access to that room. You can find full example of PHP from [PHP Quick Start](/docs/tutorials/quick_php)\\n\\n### Step 3: Display the Frontend (2 Minutes)\\n\\nNow for the final piece: the user interface. Do you need to build one from scratch? No.\\n\\nplugNmeet provides a complete, feature-rich, and customizable web client. You simply need to direct your user to the join URL generated in the previous step.\\n\\nThe join URL looks something like this:\\n`https://your-plug-n-meet.com/conference/?access_token=YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN`\\n\\nWhen a user visits this link, the plugNmeet client application loads, authenticates them with the token, and places them directly into the video meeting.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The No-Code Alternative: Official Plugins\\n\\nThe API-first approach gives you ultimate flexibility to build a custom application. But what if you\'re using a popular platform like WordPress, Moodle, or Joomla and want to get started without writing any code?\\n\\nFor these platforms, we\'ve done all the integration work for you.
